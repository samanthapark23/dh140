Look where it comes again.\\n\\nBARNARDO\\nIn the same figure like the King that\\'s dead.\\n\\nMARCELLUS, [to Horatio]\\nThou art a scholar. Speak to it, Horatio.\\n\\nBARNARDO\\nLooks he not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nMost like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.\\n\\nBARNARDO\\nIt would be spoke to.\\n\\nMARCELLUS  Speak to it, Horatio.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nWhat art thou that usurp\\'st this time of night,\\nTogether with that fair and warlike form\\nIn which the majesty of buried Denmark\\nDid sometimes march? By heaven, I charge thee,\\nspeak.\\n\\nMARCELLUS\\nIt is offended.\\n\\nBARNARDO  See, it stalks away.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nStay! speak! speak! I charge thee, speak!\\n[Ghost exits.]\\n\\nMARCELLUS  \\'Tis gone and will not answer.\\n\\nBARNARDO\\nHow now, Horatio, you tremble and look pale.\\nIs not this something more than fantasy?\\nWhat think you on \\'t?\\n\\nHORATIO\\nBefore my God, I might not this believe\\nWithout the sensible and true avouch\\nOf mine own eyes.\\n\\nMARCELLUS  Is it not like the King?\\n\\nHORATIO  As thou art to thyself.\\nSuch was the very armor he had on\\nWhen he the ambitious Norway combated.\\nSo frowned he once when, in an angry parle,\\nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.\\n\\'Tis strange.\\n\\nMARCELLUS\\nThus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,\\nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nIn what particular thought to work I know not,\\nBut in the gross and scope of mine opinion\\nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\\n\\nMARCELLUS\\nGood now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,\\nWhy this same strict and most observant watch\\nSo nightly toils the subject of the land,\\nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon\\nAnd foreign mart for implements of war,\\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task\\nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week.\\nWhat might be toward that this sweaty haste\\nDoth make the night joint laborer with the day?\\nWho is \\'t that can inform me?\\n\\nHORATIO  That can I.\\nAt least the whisper goes so: our last king,\\nWhose image even but now appeared to us,\\nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,\\nThereto pricked on by a most emulate pride,\\nDared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet\\n(For so this side of our known world esteemed him)\\nDid slay this Fortinbras, who by a sealed compact,\\nWell ratified by law and heraldry,\\nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\\nWhich he stood seized of, to the conqueror.\\nAgainst the which a moiety competent\\nWas gaged by our king, which had returned\\nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras\\nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart\\nAnd carriage of the article designed,\\nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,\\nOf unimproved mettle hot and full,\\nHath in the skirts of Norway here and there\\nSharked up a list of lawless resolutes\\nFor food and diet to some enterprise\\nThat hath a stomach in \\'t; which is no other\\n(As it doth well appear unto our state)\\nBut to recover of us, by strong hand\\nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\\nSo by his father lost. And this, I take it,\\nIs the main motive of our preparations,\\nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head\\nOf this posthaste and rummage in the land.\\n\\nBARNARDO\\nI think it be no other but e\\'en so.\\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure\\nComes armed through our watch so like the king\\nThat was and is the question of these wars.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nA mote it is to trouble the mind\\'s eye.\\nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell,\\nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead\\nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;\\nAs stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,\\nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star,\\nUpon whose influence Neptune\\'s empire stands,\\nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.\\nAnd even the like precurse of feared events,\\nAs harbingers preceding still the fates\\nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\\nHave heaven and Earth together demonstrated\\nUnto our climatures and countrymen.\\n\\n[Enter Ghost.]\\n\\nBut soft, behold! Lo, where it comes again!\\nI\\'ll cross it though it blast me.--Stay, illusion!\\n[It spreads his arms.]\\nIf thou hast any sound or use of voice,\\nSpeak to me.\\nIf there be any good thing to be done\\nThat may to thee do ease and grace to me,\\nSpeak to me.\\nIf thou art privy to thy country\\'s fate,\\nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid,\\nO, speak!\\nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth,\\nFor which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,\\nSpeak of it.\\t[The cock crows.]\\nStay and speak!--Stop it, Marcellus.\\n\\nMARCELLUS\\nShall I strike it with my partisan?\\n\\nHORATIO  Do, if it will not stand.\\n\\nBARNARDO  \\'Tis here.\\n\\nHORATIO  \\'Tis here.\\n[Ghost exits.]\\n\\nMARCELLUS  \\'Tis gone.\\nWe do it wrong, being so majestical,\\nTo offer it the show of violence,\\nFor it is as the air, invulnerable,\\nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\\n\\nBARNARDO\\nIt was about to speak when the cock crew.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nAnd then it started like a guilty thing\\nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard\\nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,\\nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat\\nAwake the god of day, and at his warning,\\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air,\\nTh\\' extravagant and erring spirit hies\\nTo his confine, and of the truth herein\\nThis present object made probation.\\n\\nMARCELLUS\\nIt faded on the crowing of the cock.\\nSome say that ever \\'gainst that season comes\\nWherein our Savior\\'s birth is celebrated,\\nThis bird of dawning singeth all night long;\\nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,\\nThe nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,\\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,\\nSo hallowed and so gracious is that time.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nSo have I heard and do in part believe it.\\nBut look, the morn in russet mantle clad\\nWalks o\\'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\\nBreak we our watch up, and by my advice\\nLet us impart what we have seen tonight\\nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,\\nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.\\nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it\\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty?\\n\\nMARCELLUS\\nLet\\'s do \\'t, I pray, and I this morning know\\nWhere we shall find him most convenient.\\n[They exit.]\\n\\nScene 2\\n=======\\n[Flourish. Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the\\nQueen, the Council, as Polonius, and his son Laertes,\\nHamlet, with others, among them Voltemand and\\nCornelius.]\\n\\n\\nKING\\nThough yet of Hamlet our dear brother\\'s death\\nThe memory be green, and that it us befitted\\nTo bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom\\nTo be contracted in one brow of woe,\\nYet so far hath discretion fought with nature\\nThat we with wisest sorrow think on him\\nTogether with remembrance of ourselves.\\nTherefore our sometime sister, now our queen,\\nTh\\' imperial jointress to this warlike state,\\nHave we (as \\'twere with a defeated joy,\\nWith an auspicious and a dropping eye,\\nWith mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,\\nIn equal scale weighing delight and dole)\\nTaken to wife. Nor have we herein barred\\nYour better wisdoms, which have freely gone\\nWith this affair along. For all, our thanks.\\nNow follows that you know. Young Fortinbras,\\nHolding a weak supposal of our worth\\nOr thinking by our late dear brother\\'s death\\nOur state to be disjoint and out of frame,\\nColleagued with this dream of his advantage,\\nHe hath not failed to pester us with message\\nImporting the surrender of those lands\\nLost by his father, with all bonds of law,\\nTo our most valiant brother--so much for him.\\nNow for ourself and for this time of meeting.\\nThus much the business is: we have here writ\\nTo Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,\\nWho, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears\\nOf this his nephew\\'s purpose, to suppress\\nHis further gait herein, in that the levies,\\nThe lists, and full proportions are all made\\nOut of his subject; and we here dispatch\\nYou, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,\\nFor bearers of this greeting to old Norway,\\nGiving to you no further personal power\\nTo business with the King more than the scope\\nOf these dilated articles allow.\\n[Giving them a paper.]\\nFarewell, and let your haste commend your duty.\\n\\nCORNELIUS/VOLTEMAND\\nIn that and all things will we show our duty.\\n\\nKING\\nWe doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.\\n[Voltemand and Cornelius exit.]\\nAnd now, Laertes, what\\'s the news with you?\\nYou told us of some suit. What is \\'t, Laertes?\\nYou cannot speak of reason to the Dane\\nAnd lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg,\\nLaertes,\\nThat shall not be my offer, not thy asking?\\nThe head is not more native to the heart,\\nThe hand more instrumental to the mouth,\\nThan is the throne of Denmark to thy father.\\nWhat wouldst thou have, Laertes?\\n\\nLAERTES  My dread lord,\\nYour leave and favor to return to France,\\nFrom whence though willingly I came to Denmark\\nTo show my duty in your coronation,\\nYet now I must confess, that duty done,\\nMy thoughts and wishes bend again toward France\\nAnd bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.\\n\\nKING\\nHave you your father\\'s leave? What says Polonius?\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nHath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave\\nBy laborsome petition, and at last\\nUpon his will I sealed my hard consent.\\nI do beseech you give him leave to go.\\n\\nKING\\nTake thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,\\nAnd thy best graces spend it at thy will.--\\nBut now, my cousin Hamlet and my son--\\n\\nHAMLET, [aside]\\nA little more than kin and less than kind.\\n\\nKING\\nHow is it that the clouds still hang on you?\\n\\nHAMLET\\nNot so, my lord; I am too much in the sun.\\n\\nQUEEN\\nGood Hamlet, cast thy nighted color off,\\nAnd let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.\\nDo not forever with thy vailed lids\\nSeek for thy noble father in the dust.\\nThou know\\'st \\'tis common; all that lives must die,\\nPassing through nature to eternity.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nAy, madam, it is common.\\n\\nQUEEN  If it be,\\nWhy seems it so particular with thee?\\n\\nHAMLET\\n\"Seems,\" madam? Nay, it is. I know not \"seems.\"\\n\\'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,\\nNor customary suits of solemn black,\\nNor windy suspiration of forced breath,\\nNo, nor the fruitful river in the eye,\\nNor the dejected havior of the visage,\\nTogether with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,\\nThat can denote me truly. These indeed \"seem,\"\\nFor they are actions that a man might play;\\nBut I have that within which passes show,\\nThese but the trappings and the suits of woe.\\n\\nKING\\n\\'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature,\\nHamlet,\\nTo give these mourning duties to your father.\\nBut you must know your father lost a father,\\nThat father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound\\nIn filial obligation for some term\\nTo do obsequious sorrow. But to persever\\nIn obstinate condolement is a course\\nOf impious stubbornness. \\'Tis unmanly grief.\\nIt shows a will most incorrect to heaven,\\nA heart unfortified, a mind impatient,\\nAn understanding simple and unschooled.\\nFor what we know must be and is as common\\nAs any the most vulgar thing to sense,\\nWhy should we in our peevish opposition\\nTake it to heart? Fie, \\'tis a fault to heaven,\\nA fault against the dead, a fault to nature,\\nTo reason most absurd, whose common theme\\nIs death of fathers, and who still hath cried,\\nFrom the first corse till he that died today,\\n\"This must be so.\" We pray you, throw to earth\\nThis unprevailing woe and think of us\\nAs of a father; for let the world take note,\\nYou are the most immediate to our throne,\\nAnd with no less nobility of love\\nThan that which dearest father bears his son\\nDo I impart toward you. For your intent\\nIn going back to school in Wittenberg,\\nIt is most retrograde to our desire,\\nAnd we beseech you, bend you to remain\\nHere in the cheer and comfort of our eye,\\nOur chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.\\n\\nQUEEN\\nLet not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.\\nI pray thee, stay with us. Go not to Wittenberg.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nI shall in all my best obey you, madam.\\n\\nKING\\nWhy, \\'tis a loving and a fair reply.\\nBe as ourself in Denmark.--Madam, come.\\nThis gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet\\nSits smiling to my heart, in grace whereof\\nNo jocund health that Denmark drinks today\\nBut the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,\\nAnd the King\\'s rouse the heaven shall bruit again,\\nRespeaking earthly thunder. Come away.\\n[Flourish. All but Hamlet exit.]\\n\\nHAMLET\\nO, that this too, too sullied flesh would melt,\\nThaw, and resolve itself into a dew,\\nOr that the Everlasting had not fixed\\nHis canon \\'gainst self-slaughter! O God, God,\\nHow weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable\\nSeem to me all the uses of this world!\\nFie on \\'t, ah fie! \\'Tis an unweeded garden\\nThat grows to seed. Things rank and gross in nature\\nPossess it merely. That it should come to this:\\nBut two months dead--nay, not so much, not two.\\nSo excellent a king, that was to this\\nHyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother\\nThat he might not beteem the winds of heaven\\nVisit her face too roughly. Heaven and Earth,\\nMust I remember? Why, she would hang on him\\nAs if increase of appetite had grown\\nBy what it fed on. And yet, within a month\\n(Let me not think on \\'t; frailty, thy name is woman!),\\nA little month, or ere those shoes were old\\nWith which she followed my poor father\\'s body,\\nLike Niobe, all tears--why she, even she\\n(O God, a beast that wants discourse of reason\\nWould have mourned longer!), married with my\\nuncle,\\nMy father\\'s brother, but no more like my father\\nThan I to Hercules. Within a month,\\nEre yet the salt of most unrighteous tears\\nHad left the flushing in her galled eyes,\\nShe married. O, most wicked speed, to post\\nWith such dexterity to incestuous sheets!\\nIt is not, nor it cannot come to good.\\nBut break, my heart, for I must hold my tongue.\\n\\n[Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Barnardo.]\\n\\n\\nHORATIO  Hail to your Lordship.\\n\\nHAMLET  I am glad to see you well.\\nHoratio--or I do forget myself!\\n\\nHORATIO\\nThe same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nSir, my good friend. I\\'ll change that name with you.\\nAnd what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?--\\nMarcellus?\\n\\nMARCELLUS  My good lord.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nI am very glad to see you. [To Barnardo.] Good\\neven, sir.--\\nBut what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?\\n\\nHORATIO\\nA truant disposition, good my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nI would not hear your enemy say so,\\nNor shall you do my ear that violence\\nTo make it truster of your own report\\nAgainst yourself. I know you are no truant.\\nBut what is your affair in Elsinore?\\nWe\\'ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nMy lord, I came to see your father\\'s funeral.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nI prithee, do not mock me, fellow student.\\nI think it was to see my mother\\'s wedding.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nIndeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nThrift, thrift, Horatio. The funeral baked meats\\nDid coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.\\nWould I had met my dearest foe in heaven\\nOr ever I had seen that day, Horatio!\\nMy father--methinks I see my father.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nWhere, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  In my mind\\'s eye, Horatio.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nI saw him once. He was a goodly king.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nHe was a man. Take him for all in all,\\nI shall not look upon his like again.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nMy lord, I think I saw him yesternight.\\n\\nHAMLET  Saw who?\\n\\nHORATIO\\nMy lord, the King your father.\\n\\nHAMLET  The King my father?\\n\\nHORATIO\\nSeason your admiration for a while\\nWith an attent ear, till I may deliver\\nUpon the witness of these gentlemen\\nThis marvel to you.\\n\\nHAMLET  For God\\'s love, let me hear!\\n\\nHORATIO\\nTwo nights together had these gentlemen,\\nMarcellus and Barnardo, on their watch,\\nIn the dead waste and middle of the night,\\nBeen thus encountered: a figure like your father,\\nArmed at point exactly, cap-a-pie,\\nAppears before them and with solemn march\\nGoes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walked\\nBy their oppressed and fear-surprised eyes\\nWithin his truncheon\\'s length, whilst they, distilled\\nAlmost to jelly with the act of fear,\\nStand dumb and speak not to him. This to me\\nIn dreadful secrecy impart they did,\\nAnd I with them the third night kept the watch,\\nWhere, as they had delivered, both in time,\\nForm of the thing (each word made true and good),\\nThe apparition comes. I knew your father;\\nThese hands are not more like.\\n\\nHAMLET  But where was this?\\n\\nMARCELLUS\\nMy lord, upon the platform where we watch.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nDid you not speak to it?\\n\\nHORATIO  My lord, I did,\\nBut answer made it none. Yet once methought\\nIt lifted up its head and did address\\nItself to motion, like as it would speak;\\nBut even then the morning cock crew loud,\\nAnd at the sound it shrunk in haste away\\nAnd vanished from our sight.\\n\\nHAMLET  \\'Tis very strange.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nAs I do live, my honored lord, \\'tis true.\\nAnd we did think it writ down in our duty\\nTo let you know of it.\\n\\nHAMLET  Indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.\\nHold you the watch tonight?\\n\\nALL  We do, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nArmed, say you?\\n\\nALL  Armed, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  From top to toe?\\n\\nALL  My lord, from head to foot.\\n\\nHAMLET  Then saw you not his face?\\n\\nHORATIO\\nO, yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up.\\n\\nHAMLET  What, looked he frowningly?\\n\\nHORATIO\\nA countenance more in sorrow than in anger.\\n\\nHAMLET  Pale or red?\\n\\nHORATIO\\nNay, very pale.\\n\\nHAMLET  And fixed his eyes upon you?\\n\\nHORATIO\\nMost constantly.\\n\\nHAMLET  I would I had been there.\\n\\nHORATIO  It would have much amazed you.\\n\\nHAMLET  Very like. Stayed it long?\\n\\nHORATIO\\nWhile one with moderate haste might tell a\\nhundred.\\n\\nBARNARDO/MARCELLUS  Longer, longer.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nNot when I saw \\'t.\\n\\nHAMLET  His beard was grizzled, no?\\n\\nHORATIO\\nIt was as I have seen it in his life,\\nA sable silvered.\\n\\nHAMLET  I will watch tonight.\\nPerchance \\'twill walk again.\\n\\nHORATIO  I warrant it will.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nIf it assume my noble father\\'s person,\\nI\\'ll speak to it, though hell itself should gape\\nAnd bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,\\nIf you have hitherto concealed this sight,\\nLet it be tenable in your silence still;\\nAnd whatsomever else shall hap tonight,\\nGive it an understanding but no tongue.\\nI will requite your loves. So fare you well.\\nUpon the platform, \\'twixt eleven and twelve,\\nI\\'ll visit you.\\n\\nALL  Our duty to your Honor.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nYour loves, as mine to you. Farewell.\\n[All but Hamlet exit.]\\nMy father\\'s spirit--in arms! All is not well.\\nI doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!\\nTill then, sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,\\nThough all the earth o\\'erwhelm them, to men\\'s\\neyes.\\n[He exits.]\\n\\nScene 3\\n=======\\n[Enter Laertes and Ophelia, his sister.]\\n\\n\\nLAERTES\\nMy necessaries are embarked. Farewell.\\nAnd, sister, as the winds give benefit\\nAnd convey is assistant, do not sleep,\\nBut let me hear from you.\\n\\nOPHELIA  Do you doubt that?\\n\\nLAERTES\\nFor Hamlet, and the trifling of his favor,\\nHold it a fashion and a toy in blood,\\nA violet in the youth of primy nature,\\nForward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,\\nThe perfume and suppliance of a minute,\\nNo more.\\n\\nOPHELIA  No more but so?\\n\\nLAERTES  Think it no more.\\nFor nature, crescent, does not grow alone\\nIn thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,\\nThe inward service of the mind and soul\\nGrows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,\\nAnd now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch\\nThe virtue of his will; but you must fear,\\nHis greatness weighed, his will is not his own,\\nFor he himself is subject to his birth.\\nHe may not, as unvalued persons do,\\nCarve for himself, for on his choice depends\\nThe safety and the health of this whole state.\\nAnd therefore must his choice be circumscribed\\nUnto the voice and yielding of that body\\nWhereof he is the head. Then, if he says he loves\\nyou,\\nIt fits your wisdom so far to believe it\\nAs he in his particular act and place\\nMay give his saying deed, which is no further\\nThan the main voice of Denmark goes withal.\\nThen weigh what loss your honor may sustain\\nIf with too credent ear you list his songs\\nOr lose your heart or your chaste treasure open\\nTo his unmastered importunity.\\nFear it, Ophelia; fear it, my dear sister,\\nAnd keep you in the rear of your affection,\\nOut of the shot and danger of desire.\\nThe chariest maid is prodigal enough\\nIf she unmask her beauty to the moon.\\nVirtue itself \\'scapes not calumnious strokes.\\nThe canker galls the infants of the spring\\nToo oft before their buttons be disclosed,\\nAnd, in the morn and liquid dew of youth,\\nContagious blastments are most imminent.\\nBe wary, then; best safety lies in fear.\\nYouth to itself rebels, though none else near.\\n\\nOPHELIA\\nI shall the effect of this good lesson keep\\nAs watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,\\nDo not, as some ungracious pastors do,\\nShow me the steep and thorny way to heaven,\\nWhiles, like a puffed and reckless libertine,\\nHimself the primrose path of dalliance treads\\nAnd recks not his own rede.\\n\\nLAERTES  O, fear me not.\\n\\n[Enter Polonius.]\\n\\nI stay too long. But here my father comes.\\nA double blessing is a double grace.\\nOccasion smiles upon a second leave.\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nYet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!\\nThe wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,\\nAnd you are stayed for. There, my blessing with\\nthee.\\nAnd these few precepts in thy memory\\nLook thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,\\nNor any unproportioned thought his act.\\nBe thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.\\nThose friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,\\nGrapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel,\\nBut do not dull thy palm with entertainment\\nOf each new-hatched, unfledged courage. Beware\\nOf entrance to a quarrel, but, being in,\\nBear \\'t that th\\' opposed may beware of thee.\\nGive every man thy ear, but few thy voice.\\nTake each man\\'s censure, but reserve thy judgment.\\nCostly thy habit as thy purse can buy,\\nBut not expressed in fancy (rich, not gaudy),\\nFor the apparel oft proclaims the man,\\nAnd they in France of the best rank and station\\nAre of a most select and generous chief in that.\\nNeither a borrower nor a lender be,\\nFor loan oft loses both itself and friend,\\nAnd borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.\\nThis above all: to thine own self be true,\\nAnd it must follow, as the night the day,\\nThou canst not then be false to any man.\\nFarewell. My blessing season this in thee.\\n\\nLAERTES\\nMost humbly do I take my leave, my lord.\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nThe time invests you. Go, your servants tend.\\n\\nLAERTES\\nFarewell, Ophelia, and remember well\\nWhat I have said to you.\\n\\nOPHELIA  \\'Tis in my memory locked,\\nAnd you yourself shall keep the key of it.\\n\\nLAERTES  Farewell.\\t[Laertes exits.]\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nWhat is \\'t, Ophelia, he hath said to you?\\n\\nOPHELIA\\nSo please you, something touching the Lord\\nHamlet.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  Marry, well bethought.\\n\\'Tis told me he hath very oft of late\\nGiven private time to you, and you yourself\\nHave of your audience been most free and\\nbounteous.\\nIf it be so (as so \\'tis put on me,\\nAnd that in way of caution), I must tell you\\nYou do not understand yourself so clearly\\nAs it behooves my daughter and your honor.\\nWhat is between you? Give me up the truth.\\n\\nOPHELIA\\nHe hath, my lord, of late made many tenders\\nOf his affection to me.\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nAffection, puh! You speak like a green girl\\nUnsifted in such perilous circumstance.\\nDo you believe his \"tenders,\" as you call them?\\n\\nOPHELIA\\nI do not know, my lord, what I should think.\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nMarry, I will teach you. Think yourself a baby\\nThat you have ta\\'en these tenders for true pay,\\nWhich are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,\\nOr (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,\\nRunning it thus) you\\'ll tender me a fool.\\n\\nOPHELIA\\nMy lord, he hath importuned me with love\\nIn honorable fashion--\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nAy, \"fashion\" you may call it. Go to, go to!\\n\\nOPHELIA\\nAnd hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,\\nWith almost all the holy vows of heaven.\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nAy, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,\\nWhen the blood burns, how prodigal the soul\\nLends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,\\nGiving more light than heat, extinct in both\\nEven in their promise as it is a-making,\\nYou must not take for fire. From this time\\nBe something scanter of your maiden presence.\\nSet your entreatments at a higher rate\\nThan a command to parle. For Lord Hamlet,\\nBelieve so much in him that he is young,\\nAnd with a larger tether may he walk\\nThan may be given you. In few, Ophelia,\\nDo not believe his vows, for they are brokers,\\nNot of that dye which their investments show,\\nBut mere implorators of unholy suits,\\nBreathing like sanctified and pious bawds\\nThe better to beguile. This is for all:\\nI would not, in plain terms, from this time forth\\nHave you so slander any moment leisure\\nAs to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.\\nLook to \\'t, I charge you. Come your ways.\\n\\nOPHELIA  I shall obey, my lord.\\n[They exit.]\\n\\nScene 4\\n=======\\n[Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.]\\n\\n\\nHAMLET\\nThe air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nIt is a nipping and an eager air.\\n\\nHAMLET  What hour now?\\n\\nHORATIO  I think it lacks of twelve.\\n\\nMARCELLUS  No, it is struck.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nIndeed, I heard it not. It then draws near the season\\nWherein the spirit held his wont to walk.\\n[A flourish of trumpets and two pieces goes off.]\\nWhat does this mean, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET\\nThe King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse,\\nKeeps wassail, and the swagg\\'ring upspring reels;\\nAnd, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,\\nThe kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out\\nThe triumph of his pledge.\\n\\nHORATIO  Is it a custom?\\n\\nHAMLET  Ay, marry, is \\'t,\\nBut, to my mind, though I am native here\\nAnd to the manner born, it is a custom\\nMore honored in the breach than the observance.\\nThis heavy-headed revel east and west\\nMakes us traduced and taxed of other nations.\\nThey clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase\\nSoil our addition. And, indeed, it takes\\nFrom our achievements, though performed at\\nheight,\\nThe pith and marrow of our attribute.\\nSo oft it chances in particular men\\nThat for some vicious mole of nature in them,\\nAs in their birth (wherein they are not guilty,\\nSince nature cannot choose his origin),\\nBy the o\\'ergrowth of some complexion\\n(Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason),\\nOr by some habit that too much o\\'erleavens\\nThe form of plausive manners--that these men,\\nCarrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,\\nBeing nature\\'s livery or fortune\\'s star,\\nHis virtues else, be they as pure as grace,\\nAs infinite as man may undergo,\\nShall in the general censure take corruption\\nFrom that particular fault. The dram of evil\\nDoth all the noble substance of a doubt\\nTo his own scandal.\\n\\n[Enter Ghost.]\\n\\n\\nHORATIO  Look, my lord, it comes.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nAngels and ministers of grace, defend us!\\nBe thou a spirit of health or goblin damned,\\nBring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from\\nhell,\\nBe thy intents wicked or charitable,\\nThou com\\'st in such a questionable shape\\nThat I will speak to thee. I\\'ll call thee \"Hamlet,\"\\n\"King,\" \"Father,\" \"Royal Dane.\" O, answer me!\\nLet me not burst in ignorance, but tell\\nWhy thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,\\nHave burst their cerements; why the sepulcher,\\nWherein we saw thee quietly interred,\\nHath oped his ponderous and marble jaws\\nTo cast thee up again. What may this mean\\nThat thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,\\nRevisits thus the glimpses of the moon,\\nMaking night hideous, and we fools of nature\\nSo horridly to shake our disposition\\nWith thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?\\nSay, why is this? Wherefore? What should we do?\\n[Ghost beckons.]\\n\\nHORATIO\\nIt beckons you to go away with it\\nAs if it some impartment did desire\\nTo you alone.\\n\\nMARCELLUS  Look with what courteous action\\nIt waves you to a more removed ground.\\nBut do not go with it.\\n\\nHORATIO  No, by no means.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nIt will not speak. Then I will follow it.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nDo not, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  Why, what should be the fear?\\nI do not set my life at a pin\\'s fee.\\nAnd for my soul, what can it do to that,\\nBeing a thing immortal as itself?\\nIt waves me forth again. I\\'ll follow it.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nWhat if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord?\\nOr to the dreadful summit of the cliff\\nThat beetles o\\'er his base into the sea,\\nAnd there assume some other horrible form\\nWhich might deprive your sovereignty of reason\\nAnd draw you into madness? Think of it.\\nThe very place puts toys of desperation,\\nWithout more motive, into every brain\\nThat looks so many fathoms to the sea\\nAnd hears it roar beneath.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nIt waves me still.--Go on, I\\'ll follow thee.\\n\\nMARCELLUS\\nYou shall not go, my lord.\\t[They hold back Hamlet.]\\n\\nHAMLET  Hold off your hands.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nBe ruled. You shall not go.\\n\\nHAMLET  My fate cries out\\nAnd makes each petty arture in this body\\nAs hardy as the Nemean lion\\'s nerve.\\nStill am I called. Unhand me, gentlemen.\\nBy heaven, I\\'ll make a ghost of him that lets me!\\nI say, away!--Go on. I\\'ll follow thee.\\n[Ghost and Hamlet exit.]\\n\\nHORATIO\\nHe waxes desperate with imagination.\\n\\nMARCELLUS\\nLet\\'s follow. \\'Tis not fit thus to obey him.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nHave after. To what issue will this come?\\n\\nMARCELLUS\\nSomething is rotten in the state of Denmark.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nHeaven will direct it.\\n\\nMARCELLUS  Nay, let\\'s follow him.\\n[They exit.]\\n\\nScene 5\\n=======\\n[Enter Ghost and Hamlet.]\\n\\n\\nHAMLET\\nWhither wilt thou lead me? Speak. I\\'ll go no\\nfurther.\\n\\nGHOST\\nMark me.\\n\\nHAMLET  I will.\\n\\nGHOST  My hour is almost come\\nWhen I to sulf\\'rous and tormenting flames\\nMust render up myself.\\n\\nHAMLET  Alas, poor ghost!\\n\\nGHOST\\nPity me not, but lend thy serious hearing\\nTo what I shall unfold.\\n\\nHAMLET  Speak. I am bound to hear.\\n\\nGHOST\\nSo art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.\\n\\nHAMLET  What?\\n\\nGHOST  I am thy father\\'s spirit,\\nDoomed for a certain term to walk the night\\nAnd for the day confined to fast in fires\\nTill the foul crimes done in my days of nature\\nAre burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid\\nTo tell the secrets of my prison house,\\nI could a tale unfold whose lightest word\\nWould harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,\\nMake thy two eyes, like stars, start from their\\nspheres,\\nThy knotted and combined locks to part,\\nAnd each particular hair to stand an end,\\nLike quills upon the fearful porpentine.\\nBut this eternal blazon must not be\\nTo ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O list!\\nIf thou didst ever thy dear father love--\\n\\nHAMLET  O God!\\n\\nGHOST\\nRevenge his foul and most unnatural murder.\\n\\nHAMLET  Murder?\\n\\nGHOST\\nMurder most foul, as in the best it is,\\nBut this most foul, strange, and unnatural.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nHaste me to know \\'t, that I, with wings as swift\\nAs meditation or the thoughts of love,\\nMay sweep to my revenge.\\n\\nGHOST  I find thee apt;\\nAnd duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed\\nThat roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,\\nWouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.\\n\\'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,\\nA serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark\\nIs by a forged process of my death\\nRankly abused. But know, thou noble youth,\\nThe serpent that did sting thy father\\'s life\\nNow wears his crown.\\n\\nHAMLET  O, my prophetic soul! My uncle!\\n\\nGHOST\\nAy, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,\\nWith witchcraft of his wits, with traitorous gifts--\\nO wicked wit and gifts, that have the power\\nSo to seduce!--won to his shameful lust\\nThe will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.\\nO Hamlet, what a falling off was there!\\nFrom me, whose love was of that dignity\\nThat it went hand in hand even with the vow\\nI made to her in marriage, and to decline\\nUpon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor\\nTo those of mine.\\nBut virtue, as it never will be moved,\\nThough lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,\\nSo, lust, though to a radiant angel linked,\\nWill sate itself in a celestial bed\\nAnd prey on garbage.\\nBut soft, methinks I scent the morning air.\\nBrief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,\\nMy custom always of the afternoon,\\nUpon my secure hour thy uncle stole\\nWith juice of cursed hebona in a vial\\nAnd in the porches of my ears did pour\\nThe leprous distilment, whose effect\\nHolds such an enmity with blood of man\\nThat swift as quicksilver it courses through\\nThe natural gates and alleys of the body,\\nAnd with a sudden vigor it doth posset\\nAnd curd, like eager droppings into milk,\\nThe thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine,\\nAnd a most instant tetter barked about,\\nMost lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust\\nAll my smooth body.\\nThus was I, sleeping, by a brother\\'s hand\\nOf life, of crown, of queen at once dispatched,\\nCut off, even in the blossoms of my sin,\\nUnhouseled, disappointed, unaneled,\\nNo reck\\'ning made, but sent to my account\\nWith all my imperfections on my head.\\nO horrible, O horrible, most horrible!\\nIf thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.\\nLet not the royal bed of Denmark be\\nA couch for luxury and damned incest.\\nBut, howsomever thou pursues this act,\\nTaint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive\\nAgainst thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven\\nAnd to those thorns that in her bosom lodge\\nTo prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.\\nThe glowworm shows the matin to be near\\nAnd \\'gins to pale his uneffectual fire.\\nAdieu, adieu, adieu. Remember me.\\t[He exits.]\\n\\nHAMLET\\nO all you host of heaven! O Earth! What else?\\nAnd shall I couple hell? O fie! Hold, hold, my heart,\\nAnd you, my sinews, grow not instant old,\\nBut bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?\\nAy, thou poor ghost, whiles memory holds a seat\\nIn this distracted globe. Remember thee?\\nYea, from the table of my memory\\nI\\'ll wipe away all trivial, fond records,\\nAll saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,\\nThat youth and observation copied there,\\nAnd thy commandment all alone shall live\\nWithin the book and volume of my brain,\\nUnmixed with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!\\nO most pernicious woman!\\nO villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!\\nMy tables--meet it is I set it down\\nThat one may smile and smile and be a villain.\\nAt least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.\\n[He writes.]\\nSo, uncle, there you are. Now to my word.\\nIt is \"adieu, adieu, remember me.\"\\nI have sworn \\'t.\\n\\n[Enter Horatio and Marcellus.]\\n\\n\\nHORATIO  My lord, my lord!\\n\\nMARCELLUS  Lord Hamlet.\\n\\nHORATIO  Heavens secure him!\\n\\nHAMLET  So be it.\\n\\nMARCELLUS  Illo, ho, ho, my lord!\\n\\nHAMLET  Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come!\\n\\nMARCELLUS\\nHow is \\'t, my noble lord?\\n\\nHORATIO  What news, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  O, wonderful!\\n\\nHORATIO\\nGood my lord, tell it.\\n\\nHAMLET  No, you will reveal it.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nNot I, my lord, by heaven.\\n\\nMARCELLUS  Nor I, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nHow say you, then? Would heart of man once think\\nit?\\nBut you\\'ll be secret?\\n\\nHORATIO/MARCELLUS   Ay, by heaven, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nThere\\'s never a villain dwelling in all Denmark\\nBut he\\'s an arrant knave.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nThere needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave\\nTo tell us this.\\n\\nHAMLET  Why, right, you are in the right.\\nAnd so, without more circumstance at all,\\nI hold it fit that we shake hands and part,\\nYou, as your business and desire shall point you\\n(For every man hath business and desire,\\nSuch as it is), and for my own poor part,\\nI will go pray.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nThese are but wild and whirling words, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nI am sorry they offend you, heartily;\\nYes, faith, heartily.\\n\\nHORATIO  There\\'s no offense, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nYes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,\\nAnd much offense, too. Touching this vision here,\\nIt is an honest ghost--that let me tell you.\\nFor your desire to know what is between us,\\nO\\'ermaster \\'t as you may. And now, good friends,\\nAs you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,\\nGive me one poor request.\\n\\nHORATIO  What is \\'t, my lord? We will.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nNever make known what you have seen tonight.\\n\\nHORATIO/MARCELLUS   My lord, we will not.\\n\\nHAMLET  Nay, but swear \\'t.\\n\\nHORATIO  In faith, my lord, not I.\\n\\nMARCELLUS  Nor I, my lord, in faith.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nUpon my sword.\\n\\nMARCELLUS  We have sworn, my lord, already.\\n\\nHAMLET  Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.\\n\\nGHOST [cries under the stage]  Swear.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nHa, ha, boy, sayst thou so? Art thou there,\\ntruepenny?\\nCome on, you hear this fellow in the cellarage.\\nConsent to swear.\\n\\nHORATIO  Propose the oath, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nNever to speak of this that you have seen,\\nSwear by my sword.\\n\\nGHOST, [beneath]  Swear.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nHic et ubique? Then we\\'ll shift our ground.\\nCome hither, gentlemen,\\nAnd lay your hands again upon my sword.\\nSwear by my sword\\nNever to speak of this that you have heard.\\n\\nGHOST, [beneath]  Swear by his sword.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nWell said, old mole.

But breathe his faults so\\nquaintly\\nThat they may seem the taints of liberty,\\nThe flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,\\nA savageness in unreclaimed blood,\\nOf general assault.\\n\\nREYNALDO  But, my good lord--\\n\\nPOLONIUS  Wherefore should you do this?\\n\\nREYNALDO  Ay, my lord, I would know that.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  Marry, sir, here\\'s my drift,\\nAnd I believe it is a fetch of wit.\\nYou, laying these slight sullies on my son,\\nAs \\'twere a thing a little soiled i\\' th\\' working,\\nMark you, your party in converse, him you would\\nsound,\\nHaving ever seen in the prenominate crimes\\nThe youth you breathe of guilty, be assured\\nHe closes with you in this consequence:\\n\"Good sir,\" or so, or \"friend,\" or \"gentleman,\"\\nAccording to the phrase or the addition\\nOf man and country--\\n\\nREYNALDO  Very good, my lord.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  And then, sir, does he this, he does--what\\nwas I about to say?

Now gather and surmise.\\n[He reads.] To the celestial, and my soul\\'s idol, the\\nmost beautified Ophelia--\\nThat\\'s an ill phrase, a vile phrase; \"beautified\" is a\\nvile phrase. But you shall hear. Thus: [He reads.]\\nIn her excellent white bosom, these, etc.--\\n\\nQUEEN  Came this from Hamlet to her?\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nGood madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.\\n[He reads the letter.]\\n\\tDoubt thou the stars are fire,\\n\\t   Doubt that the sun doth move,\\n\\tDoubt truth to be a liar,\\n\\t   But never doubt I love.\\nO dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers. I have not\\nart to reckon my groans, but that I love thee best, O\\nmost best, believe it. Adieu.\\nThine evermore, most dear lady, whilst\\nthis machine is to him, Hamlet.\\nThis, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,\\nAnd more above, hath his solicitings,\\nAs they fell out by time, by means, and place,\\nAll given to mine ear.\\n\\nKING  But how hath she received his love?\\n\\nPOLONIUS  What do you think of me?\\n\\nKING\\nAs of a man faithful and honorable.\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nI would fain prove so. But what might you think,\\nWhen I had seen this hot love on the wing\\n(As I perceived it, I must tell you that,\\nBefore my daughter told me), what might you,\\nOr my dear Majesty your queen here, think,\\nIf I had played the desk or table-book\\nOr given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,\\nOr looked upon this love with idle sight?\\nWhat might you think? No, I went round to work,\\nAnd my young mistress thus I did bespeak:\\n\"Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.\\nThis must not be.\" And then I prescripts gave her,\\nThat she should lock herself from his resort,\\nAdmit no messengers, receive no tokens;\\nWhich done, she took the fruits of my advice,\\nAnd he, repelled (a short tale to make),\\nFell into a sadness, then into a fast,\\nThence to a watch, thence into a weakness,\\nThence to a lightness, and, by this declension,\\nInto the madness wherein now he raves\\nAnd all we mourn for.\\n\\nKING, [to Queen]  Do you think \\'tis this?\\n\\nQUEEN  It may be, very like.\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nHath there been such a time (I would fain know\\nthat)\\nThat I have positively said \"\\'Tis so,\"\\nWhen it proved otherwise?\\n\\nKING  Not that I know.\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nTake this from this, if this be otherwise.\\nIf circumstances lead me, I will find\\nWhere truth is hid, though it were hid, indeed,\\nWithin the center.\\n\\nKING  How may we try it further?\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nYou know sometimes he walks four hours together\\nHere in the lobby.\\n\\nQUEEN  So he does indeed.\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nAt such a time I\\'ll loose my daughter to him.\\n[To the King.] Be you and I behind an arras then.\\nMark the encounter. If he love her not,\\nAnd be not from his reason fall\\'n thereon,\\nLet me be no assistant for a state,\\nBut keep a farm and carters.\\n\\nKING  We will try it.\\n\\n[Enter Hamlet reading on a book.]\\n\\n\\nQUEEN\\nBut look where sadly the poor wretch comes\\nreading.\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nAway, I do beseech you both, away.\\nI\\'ll board him presently. O, give me leave.\\n[King and Queen exit with Attendants.]\\nHow does my good Lord Hamlet?\\n\\nHAMLET  Well, God-a-mercy.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  Do you know me, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  Not I, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  Then I would you were so honest a man.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  Honest, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to\\nbe one man picked out of ten thousand.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  That\\'s very true, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  For if the sun breed maggots in a dead\\ndog, being a good kissing carrion--Have you a\\ndaughter?\\n\\nPOLONIUS  I have, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  Let her not walk i\\' th\\' sun. Conception is a\\nblessing, but, as your daughter may conceive,\\nfriend, look to \\'t.\\n\\nPOLONIUS, [aside]  How say you by that? Still harping on\\nmy daughter. Yet he knew me not at first; he said I\\nwas a fishmonger. He is far gone. And truly, in my\\nyouth, I suffered much extremity for love, very near\\nthis. I\\'ll speak to him again.--What do you read, my\\nlord?\\n\\nHAMLET  Words, words, words.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  What is the matter, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  Between who?\\n\\nPOLONIUS  I mean the matter that you read, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here\\nthat old men have gray beards, that their faces are\\nwrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and\\nplum-tree gum, and that they have a plentiful lack of\\nwit, together with most weak hams; all which, sir,\\nthough I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I\\nhold it not honesty to have it thus set down; for\\nyourself, sir, shall grow old as I am, if, like a crab,\\nyou could go backward.\\n\\nPOLONIUS, [aside]  Though this be madness, yet there is\\nmethod in \\'t.--Will you walk out of the air, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  Into my grave?\\n\\nPOLONIUS  Indeed, that\\'s out of the air. [Aside.] How\\npregnant sometimes his replies are! A happiness\\nthat often madness hits on, which reason and\\nsanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I\\nwill leave him and suddenly contrive the means of\\nmeeting between him and my daughter.--My lord,\\nI will take my leave of you.\\n\\nHAMLET  You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I\\nwill more willingly part withal--except my life,\\nexcept my life, except my life.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  Fare you well, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET, [aside]  These tedious old fools.\\n\\n[Enter Guildenstern and Rosencrantz.]\\n\\n\\nPOLONIUS  You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ, [to Polonius]  God save you, sir.\\n[Polonius exits.]\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN  My honored lord.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  My most dear lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  My excellent good friends! How dost thou,\\nGuildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do\\nyou both?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nAs the indifferent children of the earth.\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN\\nHappy in that we are not overhappy.\\nOn Fortune\\'s cap, we are not the very button.\\n\\nHAMLET  Nor the soles of her shoe?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Neither, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  Then you live about her waist, or in the\\nmiddle of her favors?\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN  Faith, her privates we.\\n\\nHAMLET  In the secret parts of Fortune? O, most true!\\nShe is a strumpet. What news?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  None, my lord, but that the world\\'s\\ngrown honest.\\n\\nHAMLET  Then is doomsday near. But your news is not\\ntrue. Let me question more in particular. What\\nhave you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of\\nFortune that she sends you to prison hither?\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN  Prison, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  Denmark\\'s a prison.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Then is the world one.\\n\\nHAMLET  A goodly one, in which there are many confines,\\nwards, and dungeons, Denmark being one o\\'\\nth\\' worst.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  We think not so, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  Why, then, \\'tis none to you, for there is\\nnothing either good or bad but thinking makes it\\nso. To me, it is a prison.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Why, then, your ambition makes it one.\\n\\'Tis too narrow for your mind.\\n\\nHAMLET  O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and\\ncount myself a king of infinite space, were it not\\nthat I have bad dreams.\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN  Which dreams, indeed, are ambition,\\nfor the very substance of the ambitious is merely\\nthe shadow of a dream.\\n\\nHAMLET  A dream itself is but a shadow.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy\\nand light a quality that it is but a shadow\\'s shadow.\\n\\nHAMLET  Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs\\nand outstretched heroes the beggars\\' shadows.\\nShall we to th\\' court? For, by my fay, I cannot\\nreason.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ/GUILDENSTERN  We\\'ll wait upon you.\\n\\nHAMLET  No such matter. I will not sort you with the\\nrest of my servants, for, to speak to you like an\\nhonest man, I am most dreadfully attended. But,\\nin the beaten way of friendship, what make you at\\nElsinore?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  To visit you, my lord, no other occasion.\\n\\nHAMLET  Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks;\\nbut I thank you, and sure, dear friends, my thanks\\nare too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for?\\nIs it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation?\\nCome, come, deal justly with me. Come, come; nay,\\nspeak.\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN  What should we say, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  Anything but to th\\' purpose. You were sent\\nfor, and there is a kind of confession in your looks\\nwhich your modesties have not craft enough to\\ncolor. I know the good king and queen have sent for\\nyou.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  To what end, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  That you must teach me. But let me conjure\\nyou by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy\\nof our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved\\nlove, and by what more dear a better\\nproposer can charge you withal: be even and direct\\nwith me whether you were sent for or no.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ, [to Guildenstern]  What say you?\\n\\nHAMLET, [aside]  Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If\\nyou love me, hold not off.\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN  My lord, we were sent for.\\n\\nHAMLET  I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation\\nprevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the\\nKing and Queen molt no feather. I have of late, but\\nwherefore I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all\\ncustom of exercises, and, indeed, it goes so heavily\\nwith my disposition that this goodly frame, the\\nEarth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most\\nexcellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o\\'erhanging\\nfirmament, this majestical roof, fretted\\nwith golden fire--why, it appeareth nothing to me\\nbut a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors.\\nWhat a piece of work is a man, how noble in\\nreason, how infinite in faculties, in form and moving\\nhow express and admirable; in action how like\\nan angel, in apprehension how like a god: the\\nbeauty of the world, the paragon of animals--and\\nyet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? Man\\ndelights not me, no, nor women neither, though by\\nyour smiling you seem to say so.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  My lord, there was no such stuff in my\\nthoughts.\\n\\nHAMLET  Why did you laugh, then, when I said \"man\\ndelights not me\"?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  To think, my lord, if you delight not in\\nman, what Lenten entertainment the players shall\\nreceive from you. We coted them on the way, and\\nhither are they coming to offer you service.\\n\\nHAMLET  He that plays the king shall be welcome--his\\nMajesty shall have tribute on me. The adventurous\\nknight shall use his foil and target, the lover shall\\nnot sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his\\npart in peace, the clown shall make those laugh\\nwhose lungs are tickle o\\' th\\' sear, and the lady\\nshall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall\\nhalt for \\'t. What players are they?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Even those you were wont to take such\\ndelight in, the tragedians of the city.\\n\\nHAMLET  How chances it they travel? Their residence,\\nboth in reputation and profit, was better both ways.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  I think their inhibition comes by the\\nmeans of the late innovation.\\n\\nHAMLET  Do they hold the same estimation they did\\nwhen I was in the city? Are they so followed?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  No, indeed are they not.\\n\\nHAMLET  How comes it? Do they grow rusty?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Nay, their endeavor keeps in the wonted\\npace. But there is, sir, an aerie of children, little\\neyases, that cry out on the top of question and are\\nmost tyrannically clapped for \\'t. These are now the\\nfashion and so berattle the common stages (so\\nthey call them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid\\nof goose quills and dare scarce come thither.\\n\\nHAMLET  What, are they children? Who maintains \\'em?\\nHow are they escoted? Will they pursue the quality\\nno longer than they can sing? Will they not say\\nafterwards, if they should grow themselves to common\\nplayers (as it is most like, if their means are\\nno better), their writers do them wrong to make\\nthem exclaim against their own succession?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Faith, there has been much to-do on\\nboth sides, and the nation holds it no sin to tar\\nthem to controversy. There was for a while no\\nmoney bid for argument unless the poet and the\\nplayer went to cuffs in the question.\\n\\nHAMLET  Is \\'t possible?\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN  O, there has been much throwing\\nabout of brains.\\n\\nHAMLET  Do the boys carry it away?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Ay, that they do, my lord--Hercules\\nand his load too.\\n\\nHAMLET  It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of\\nDenmark, and those that would make mouths at\\nhim while my father lived give twenty, forty, fifty,\\na hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little.\\n\\'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural,\\nif philosophy could find it out.\\n[A flourish for the Players.]\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN  There are the players.\\n\\nHAMLET  Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore.\\nYour hands, come then. Th\\' appurtenance of welcome\\nis fashion and ceremony. Let me comply\\nwith you in this garb, lest my extent to the players,\\nwhich, I tell you, must show fairly outwards, should\\nmore appear like entertainment than yours. You are\\nwelcome. But my uncle-father and aunt-mother are\\ndeceived.\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN  In what, my dear lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  I am but mad north-north-west. When the\\nwind is southerly, I know a hawk from a handsaw.\\n\\n[Enter Polonius.]\\n\\n\\nPOLONIUS  Well be with you, gentlemen.\\n\\nHAMLET  Hark you, Guildenstern, and you too--at\\neach ear a hearer! That great baby you see there is\\nnot yet out of his swaddling clouts.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Haply he is the second time come to\\nthem, for they say an old man is twice a child.\\n\\nHAMLET  I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the\\nplayers; mark it.--You say right, sir, a Monday\\nmorning, \\'twas then indeed.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  My lord, I have news to tell you.\\n\\nHAMLET  My lord, I have news to tell you: when Roscius\\nwas an actor in Rome--\\n\\nPOLONIUS  The actors are come hither, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  Buzz, buzz.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  Upon my honor--\\n\\nHAMLET  Then came each actor on his ass.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  The best actors in the world, either for\\ntragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,\\nhistorical-pastoral, tragical-historical,\\ntragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or\\npoem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor\\nPlautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty,\\nthese are the only men.\\n\\nHAMLET  O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure\\nhadst thou!\\n\\nPOLONIUS  What a treasure had he, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  Why,\\n\\tOne fair daughter, and no more,\\n\\tThe which he loved passing well.\\n\\nPOLONIUS, [aside]  Still on my daughter.\\n\\nHAMLET  Am I not i\\' th\\' right, old Jephthah?\\n\\nPOLONIUS  If you call me \"Jephthah,\" my lord: I have a\\ndaughter that I love passing well.\\n\\nHAMLET  Nay, that follows not.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  What follows then, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  Why,\\n\\tAs by lot, God wot\\nand then, you know,\\n\\tIt came to pass, as most like it was--\\nthe first row of the pious chanson will show you\\nmore, for look where my abridgment comes.\\n\\n[Enter the Players.]\\n\\nYou are welcome, masters; welcome all.--I am glad\\nto see thee well.--Welcome, good friends.--O my\\nold friend! Why, thy face is valanced since I saw thee\\nlast. Com\\'st thou to beard me in Denmark?--What,\\nmy young lady and mistress! By \\'r Lady, your Ladyship\\nis nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by\\nthe altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a\\npiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the\\nring. Masters, you are all welcome. We\\'ll e\\'en to \\'t\\nlike French falconers, fly at anything we see. We\\'ll\\nhave a speech straight. Come, give us a taste of your\\nquality. Come, a passionate speech.\\n\\nFIRST PLAYER  What speech, my good lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it\\nwas never acted, or, if it was, not above once; for\\nthe play, I remember, pleased not the million:\\n\\'twas caviary to the general. But it was (as I\\nreceived it, and others whose judgments in such\\nmatters cried in the top of mine) an excellent play,\\nwell digested in the scenes, set down with as much\\nmodesty as cunning. I remember one said there\\nwere no sallets in the lines to make the matter\\nsavory, nor no matter in the phrase that might indict\\nthe author of affection, but called it an honest\\nmethod, as wholesome as sweet and, by very much,\\nmore handsome than fine. One speech in \\'t I\\nchiefly loved. \\'Twas Aeneas\\' tale to Dido, and\\nthereabout of it especially when he speaks of\\nPriam\\'s slaughter. If it live in your memory, begin at\\nthis line--let me see, let me see:\\nThe rugged Pyrrhus, like th\\' Hyrcanian beast--\\n\\'tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:\\nThe rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,\\nBlack as his purpose, did the night resemble\\nWhen he lay couched in th\\' ominous horse,\\nHath now this dread and black complexion smeared\\nWith heraldry more dismal. Head to foot,\\nNow is he total gules, horridly tricked\\nWith blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,\\nBaked and impasted with the parching streets,\\nThat lend a tyrannous and a damned light\\nTo their lord\\'s murder. Roasted in wrath and fire,\\nAnd thus o\\'ersized with coagulate gore,\\nWith eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus\\nOld grandsire Priam seeks.\\nSo, proceed you.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  \\'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good\\naccent and good discretion.\\n\\nFIRST PLAYER  Anon he finds him\\nStriking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,\\nRebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,\\nRepugnant to command. Unequal matched,\\nPyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;\\nBut with the whiff and wind of his fell sword\\nTh\\' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,\\nSeeming to feel this blow, with flaming top\\nStoops to his base, and with a hideous crash\\nTakes prisoner Pyrrhus\\' ear. For lo, his sword,\\nWhich was declining on the milky head\\nOf reverend Priam, seemed i\\' th\\' air to stick.\\nSo as a painted tyrant Pyrrhus stood\\nAnd, like a neutral to his will and matter,\\nDid nothing.\\nBut as we often see against some storm\\nA silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,\\nThe bold winds speechless, and the orb below\\nAs hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder\\nDoth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus\\' pause,\\nAroused vengeance sets him new a-work,\\nAnd never did the Cyclops\\' hammers fall\\nOn Mars\\'s armor, forged for proof eterne,\\nWith less remorse than Pyrrhus\\' bleeding sword\\nNow falls on Priam.\\nOut, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods\\nIn general synod take away her power,\\nBreak all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,\\nAnd bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven\\nAs low as to the fiends!\\n\\nPOLONIUS  This is too long.\\n\\nHAMLET  It shall to the barber\\'s with your beard.--\\nPrithee say on. He\\'s for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or\\nhe sleeps. Say on; come to Hecuba.\\n\\nFIRST PLAYER\\nBut who, ah woe, had seen the mobled queen--\\n\\nHAMLET  \"The mobled queen\"?\\n\\nPOLONIUS  That\\'s good. \"Mobled queen\" is good.\\n\\nFIRST PLAYER\\nRun barefoot up and down, threat\\'ning the flames\\nWith bisson rheum, a clout upon that head\\nWhere late the diadem stood, and for a robe,\\nAbout her lank and all o\\'erteemed loins\\nA blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up--\\nWho this had seen, with tongue in venom steeped,\\n\\'Gainst Fortune\\'s state would treason have\\npronounced.\\nBut if the gods themselves did see her then\\nWhen she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport\\nIn mincing with his sword her husband\\'s limbs,\\nThe instant burst of clamor that she made\\n(Unless things mortal move them not at all)\\nWould have made milch the burning eyes of heaven\\nAnd passion in the gods.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  Look whe\\'er he has not turned his color and\\nhas tears in \\'s eyes. Prithee, no more.\\n\\nHAMLET  \\'Tis well. I\\'ll have thee speak out the rest of\\nthis soon.--Good my lord, will you see the players\\nwell bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used,\\nfor they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the\\ntime. After your death you were better have a bad\\nepitaph than their ill report while you live.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  My lord, I will use them according to their\\ndesert.\\n\\nHAMLET  God\\'s bodykins, man, much better! Use every\\nman after his desert and who shall \\'scape\\nwhipping? Use them after your own honor and\\ndignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is in\\nyour bounty. Take them in.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  Come, sirs.\\n\\nHAMLET  Follow him, friends. We\\'ll hear a play\\ntomorrow. [As Polonius and Players exit, Hamlet speaks to\\nthe First Player.] Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can\\nyou play \"The Murder of Gonzago\"?\\n\\nFIRST PLAYER  Ay, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  We\\'ll ha \\'t tomorrow night. You could, for a\\nneed, study a speech of some dozen or sixteen\\nlines, which I would set down and insert in \\'t,\\ncould you not?\\n\\nFIRST PLAYER  Ay, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  Very well. Follow that lord--and look you\\nmock him not. [First Player exits.] My good friends,\\nI\\'ll leave you till night. You are welcome to Elsinore.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Good my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nAy, so, good-bye to you.\\n[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern exit.]\\nNow I am alone.\\nO, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!\\nIs it not monstrous that this player here,\\nBut in a fiction, in a dream of passion,\\nCould force his soul so to his own conceit\\nThat from her working all his visage wanned,\\nTears in his eyes, distraction in his aspect,\\nA broken voice, and his whole function suiting\\nWith forms to his conceit--and all for nothing!\\nFor Hecuba!\\nWhat\\'s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,\\nThat he should weep for her? What would he do\\nHad he the motive and the cue for passion\\nThat I have? He would drown the stage with tears\\nAnd cleave the general ear with horrid speech,\\nMake mad the guilty and appall the free,\\nConfound the ignorant and amaze indeed\\nThe very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,\\nA dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak\\nLike John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,\\nAnd can say nothing--no, not for a king\\nUpon whose property and most dear life\\nA damned defeat was made. Am I a coward?\\nWho calls me \"villain\"? breaks my pate across?\\nPlucks off my beard and blows it in my face?\\nTweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i\\' th\\' throat\\nAs deep as to the lungs? Who does me this?\\nHa! \\'Swounds, I should take it! For it cannot be\\nBut I am pigeon-livered and lack gall\\nTo make oppression bitter, or ere this\\nI should have fatted all the region kites\\nWith this slave\\'s offal. Bloody, bawdy villain!\\nRemorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless\\nvillain!\\nO vengeance!\\nWhy, what an ass am I! This is most brave,\\nThat I, the son of a dear father murdered,\\nPrompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,\\nMust, like a whore, unpack my heart with words\\nAnd fall a-cursing like a very drab,\\nA stallion! Fie upon \\'t! Foh!\\nAbout, my brains!--Hum, I have heard\\nThat guilty creatures sitting at a play\\nHave, by the very cunning of the scene,\\nBeen struck so to the soul that presently\\nThey have proclaimed their malefactions;\\nFor murder, though it have no tongue, will speak\\nWith most miraculous organ. I\\'ll have these players\\nPlay something like the murder of my father\\nBefore mine uncle. I\\'ll observe his looks;\\nI\\'ll tent him to the quick. If he do blench,\\nI know my course. The spirit that I have seen\\nMay be a devil, and the devil hath power\\nT\\' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps,\\nOut of my weakness and my melancholy,\\nAs he is very potent with such spirits,\\nAbuses me to damn me. I\\'ll have grounds\\nMore relative than this. The play\\'s the thing\\nWherein I\\'ll catch the conscience of the King.\\n[He exits.]\\n\\n\\nACT 3\\n=====\\n\\nScene 1\\n=======\\n[Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,\\nGuildenstern, and Lords.]\\n\\n\\nKING\\nAnd can you by no drift of conference\\nGet from him why he puts on this confusion,\\nGrating so harshly all his days of quiet\\nWith turbulent and dangerous lunacy?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nHe does confess he feels himself distracted,\\nBut from what cause he will by no means speak.\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN\\nNor do we find him forward to be sounded,\\nBut with a crafty madness keeps aloof\\nWhen we would bring him on to some confession\\nOf his true state.\\n\\nQUEEN  Did he receive you well?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Most like a gentleman.\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN\\nBut with much forcing of his disposition.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nNiggard of question, but of our demands\\nMost free in his reply.\\n\\nQUEEN  Did you assay him to any pastime?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nMadam, it so fell out that certain players\\nWe o\\'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,\\nAnd there did seem in him a kind of joy\\nTo hear of it.

[To Ophelia.] Read on this\\nbook,\\nThat show of such an exercise may color\\nYour loneliness.--We are oft to blame in this\\n(\\'Tis too much proved), that with devotion\\'s visage\\nAnd pious action we do sugar o\\'er\\nThe devil himself.\\n\\nKING, [aside]  O, \\'tis too true!\\nHow smart a lash that speech doth give my\\nconscience.\\nThe harlot\\'s cheek beautied with plast\\'ring art\\nIs not more ugly to the thing that helps it\\nThan is my deed to my most painted word.\\nO heavy burden!\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nI hear him coming. Let\\'s withdraw, my lord.\\n[They withdraw.]\\n\\n[Enter Hamlet.]\\n\\n\\nHAMLET\\nTo be or not to be--that is the question:\\nWhether \\'tis nobler in the mind to suffer\\nThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,\\nOr to take arms against a sea of troubles\\nAnd, by opposing, end them. To die, to sleep--\\nNo more--and by a sleep to say we end\\nThe heartache and the thousand natural shocks\\nThat flesh is heir to--\\'tis a consummation\\nDevoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep--\\nTo sleep, perchance to dream. Ay, there\\'s the rub,\\nFor in that sleep of death what dreams may come,\\nWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,\\nMust give us pause. There\\'s the respect\\nThat makes calamity of so long life.\\nFor who would bear the whips and scorns of time,\\nTh\\' oppressor\\'s wrong, the proud man\\'s contumely,\\nThe pangs of despised love, the law\\'s delay,\\nThe insolence of office, and the spurns\\nThat patient merit of th\\' unworthy takes,\\nWhen he himself might his quietus make\\nWith a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,\\nTo grunt and sweat under a weary life,\\nBut that the dread of something after death,\\nThe undiscovered country from whose bourn\\nNo traveler returns, puzzles the will\\nAnd makes us rather bear those ills we have\\nThan fly to others that we know not of?\\nThus conscience does make cowards of us all,\\nAnd thus the native hue of resolution\\nIs sicklied o\\'er with the pale cast of thought,\\nAnd enterprises of great pitch and moment\\nWith this regard their currents turn awry\\nAnd lose the name of action.--Soft you now,\\nThe fair Ophelia.--Nymph, in thy orisons\\nBe all my sins remembered.\\n\\nOPHELIA  Good my lord,\\nHow does your Honor for this many a day?\\n\\nHAMLET  I humbly thank you, well.\\n\\nOPHELIA\\nMy lord, I have remembrances of yours\\nThat I have longed long to redeliver.\\nI pray you now receive them.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nNo, not I. I never gave you aught.\\n\\nOPHELIA\\nMy honored lord, you know right well you did,\\nAnd with them words of so sweet breath composed\\nAs made the things more rich. Their perfume\\nlost,\\nTake these again, for to the noble mind\\nRich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.\\nThere, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  Ha, ha, are you honest?\\n\\nOPHELIA  My lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  Are you fair?\\n\\nOPHELIA  What means your Lordship?\\n\\nHAMLET  That if you be honest and fair, your honesty\\nshould admit no discourse to your beauty.\\n\\nOPHELIA  Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce\\nthan with honesty?\\n\\nHAMLET  Ay, truly, for the power of beauty will sooner\\ntransform honesty from what it is to a bawd than\\nthe force of honesty can translate beauty into his\\nlikeness. This was sometime a paradox, but now\\nthe time gives it proof. I did love you once.\\n\\nOPHELIA  Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.\\n\\nHAMLET  You should not have believed me, for virtue\\ncannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall\\nrelish of it. I loved you not.\\n\\nOPHELIA  I was the more deceived.\\n\\nHAMLET  Get thee to a nunnery. Why wouldst thou be\\na breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest,\\nbut yet I could accuse me of such things that it\\nwere better my mother had not borne me: I am\\nvery proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offenses\\nat my beck than I have thoughts to put them\\nin, imagination to give them shape, or time to act\\nthem in. What should such fellows as I do crawling\\nbetween earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves\\nall; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.\\nWhere\\'s your father?\\n\\nOPHELIA  At home, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  Let the doors be shut upon him that he may\\nplay the fool nowhere but in \\'s own house. Farewell.\\n\\nOPHELIA  O, help him, you sweet heavens!\\n\\nHAMLET  If thou dost marry, I\\'ll give thee this plague\\nfor thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as\\nsnow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a\\nnunnery, farewell. Or if thou wilt needs marry,\\nmarry a fool, for wise men know well enough what\\nmonsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go, and\\nquickly too. Farewell.\\n\\nOPHELIA  Heavenly powers, restore him!\\n\\nHAMLET  I have heard of your paintings too, well\\nenough. God hath given you one face, and you\\nmake yourselves another. You jig and amble, and\\nyou lisp; you nickname God\\'s creatures and make\\nyour wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I\\'ll no\\nmore on \\'t. It hath made me mad. I say we will have\\nno more marriage. Those that are married already,\\nall but one, shall live. The rest shall keep as they are.\\nTo a nunnery, go.\\t[He exits.]\\n\\nOPHELIA\\nO, what a noble mind is here o\\'erthrown!\\nThe courtier\\'s, soldier\\'s, scholar\\'s, eye, tongue,\\nsword,\\nTh\\' expectancy and rose of the fair state,\\nThe glass of fashion and the mold of form,\\nTh\\' observed of all observers, quite, quite down!\\nAnd I, of ladies most deject and wretched,\\nThat sucked the honey of his musicked vows,\\nNow see that noble and most sovereign reason,\\nLike sweet bells jangled, out of time and harsh;\\nThat unmatched form and stature of blown youth\\nBlasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me\\nT\\' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!\\n\\nKING, [advancing with Polonius]\\nLove? His affections do not that way tend;\\nNor what he spake, though it lacked form a little,\\nWas not like madness. There\\'s something in his soul\\nO\\'er which his melancholy sits on brood,\\nAnd I do doubt the hatch and the disclose\\nWill be some danger; which for to prevent,\\nI have in quick determination\\nThus set it down: he shall with speed to England\\nFor the demand of our neglected tribute.\\nHaply the seas, and countries different,\\nWith variable objects, shall expel\\nThis something-settled matter in his heart,\\nWhereon his brains still beating puts him thus\\nFrom fashion of himself. What think you on \\'t?\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nIt shall do well. But yet do I believe\\nThe origin and commencement of his grief\\nSprung from neglected love.--How now, Ophelia?\\nYou need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;\\nWe heard it all.--My lord, do as you please,\\nBut, if you hold it fit, after the play\\nLet his queen-mother all alone entreat him\\nTo show his grief. Let her be round with him;\\nAnd I\\'ll be placed, so please you, in the ear\\nOf all their conference. If she find him not,\\nTo England send him, or confine him where\\nYour wisdom best shall think.\\n\\nKING  It shall be so.\\nMadness in great ones must not unwatched go.\\n[They exit.]\\n\\nScene 2\\n=======\\n[Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.]\\n\\n\\nHAMLET  Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced\\nit to you, trippingly on the tongue; but if you mouth\\nit, as many of our players do, I had as lief the\\ntown-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air\\ntoo much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;\\nfor in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,\\nwhirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and\\nbeget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O,\\nit offends me to the soul to hear a robustious,\\nperiwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very\\nrags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the\\nmost part are capable of nothing but inexplicable\\ndumb shows and noise. I would have such a fellow\\nwhipped for o\\'erdoing Termagant. It out-Herods\\nHerod. Pray you, avoid it.\\n\\nPLAYER  I warrant your Honor.\\n\\nHAMLET  Be not too tame neither, but let your own\\ndiscretion be your tutor. Suit the action to the\\nword, the word to the action, with this special\\nobservance, that you o\\'erstep not the modesty of\\nnature. For anything so o\\'erdone is from the purpose\\nof playing, whose end, both at the first and\\nnow, was and is to hold, as \\'twere, the mirror up to\\nnature, to show virtue her own feature, scorn her\\nown image, and the very age and body of the time\\nhis form and pressure. Now this overdone or come\\ntardy off, though it makes the unskillful laugh,\\ncannot but make the judicious grieve, the censure\\nof the which one must in your allowance o\\'erweigh\\na whole theater of others. O, there be players that I\\nhave seen play and heard others praise (and that\\nhighly), not to speak it profanely, that, neither\\nhaving th\\' accent of Christians nor the gait of\\nChristian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and\\nbellowed that I have thought some of nature\\'s\\njourneymen had made men, and not made them\\nwell, they imitated humanity so abominably.\\n\\nPLAYER  I hope we have reformed that indifferently\\nwith us, sir.\\n\\nHAMLET  O, reform it altogether. And let those that play\\nyour clowns speak no more than is set down for\\nthem, for there be of them that will themselves\\nlaugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators\\nto laugh too, though in the meantime some necessary\\nquestion of the play be then to be considered.\\nThat\\'s villainous and shows a most pitiful ambition\\nin the fool that uses it. Go make you ready.\\n[Players exit.]\\n\\n[Enter Polonius, Guildenstern, and Rosencrantz.]\\n\\nHow now, my lord, will the King hear this piece of\\nwork?\\n\\nPOLONIUS  And the Queen too, and that presently.\\n\\nHAMLET  Bid the players make haste.\\t[Polonius exits.]\\nWill you two help to hasten them?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Ay, my lord.\\t[They exit.]\\n\\nHAMLET  What ho, Horatio!\\n\\n[Enter Horatio.]\\n\\n\\nHORATIO  Here, sweet lord, at your service.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nHoratio, thou art e\\'en as just a man\\nAs e\\'er my conversation coped withal.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nO, my dear lord--\\n\\nHAMLET  Nay, do not think I flatter,\\nFor what advancement may I hope from thee\\nThat no revenue hast but thy good spirits\\nTo feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be\\nflattered?\\nNo, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp\\nAnd crook the pregnant hinges of the knee\\nWhere thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?\\nSince my dear soul was mistress of her choice\\nAnd could of men distinguish, her election\\nHath sealed thee for herself. For thou hast been\\nAs one in suffering all that suffers nothing,\\nA man that Fortune\\'s buffets and rewards\\nHast ta\\'en with equal thanks; and blessed are those\\nWhose blood and judgment are so well\\ncommeddled\\nThat they are not a pipe for Fortune\\'s finger\\nTo sound what stop she please. Give me that man\\nThat is not passion\\'s slave, and I will wear him\\nIn my heart\\'s core, ay, in my heart of heart,\\nAs I do thee.--Something too much of this.--\\nThere is a play tonight before the King.\\nOne scene of it comes near the circumstance\\nWhich I have told thee of my father\\'s death.\\nI prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,\\nEven with the very comment of thy soul\\nObserve my uncle. If his occulted guilt\\nDo not itself unkennel in one speech,\\nIt is a damned ghost that we have seen,\\nAnd my imaginations are as foul\\nAs Vulcan\\'s stithy. Give him heedful note,\\nFor I mine eyes will rivet to his face,\\nAnd, after, we will both our judgments join\\nIn censure of his seeming.\\n\\nHORATIO  Well, my lord.\\nIf he steal aught the whilst this play is playing\\nAnd \\'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.\\n[Sound a flourish.]\\n\\nHAMLET  They are coming to the play. I must be idle.\\nGet you a place.\\n\\n[Enter Trumpets and Kettle Drums. Enter King, Queen,\\nPolonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and other\\nLords attendant with the King\\'s guard carrying\\ntorches.]\\n\\n\\nKING  How fares our cousin Hamlet?\\n\\nHAMLET  Excellent, i\\' faith, of the chameleon\\'s dish. I\\neat the air, promise-crammed. You cannot feed\\ncapons so.\\n\\nKING  I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These\\nwords are not mine.\\n\\nHAMLET  No, nor mine now. [To Polonius.] My lord, you\\nplayed once i\\' th\\' university, you say?\\n\\nPOLONIUS  That did I, my lord, and was accounted a\\ngood actor.\\n\\nHAMLET  What did you enact?\\n\\nPOLONIUS  I did enact Julius Caesar. I was killed i\\' th\\'\\nCapitol. Brutus killed me.\\n\\nHAMLET  It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a\\ncalf there.--Be the players ready?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Ay, my lord. They stay upon your\\npatience.\\n\\nQUEEN  Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.\\n\\nHAMLET  No, good mother. Here\\'s metal more\\nattractive.\\t[Hamlet takes a place near Ophelia.]\\n\\nPOLONIUS, [to the King]  Oh, ho! Do you mark that?\\n\\nHAMLET  Lady, shall I lie in your lap?\\n\\nOPHELIA  No, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  I mean, my head upon your lap?\\n\\nOPHELIA  Ay, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  Do you think I meant country matters?\\n\\nOPHELIA  I think nothing, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  That\\'s a fair thought to lie between maids\\'\\nlegs.\\n\\nOPHELIA  What is, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  Nothing.\\n\\nOPHELIA  You are merry, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  Who, I?\\n\\nOPHELIA  Ay, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  O God, your only jig-maker. What should a\\nman do but be merry? For look you how cheerfully\\nmy mother looks, and my father died within \\'s two\\nhours.\\n\\nOPHELIA  Nay, \\'tis twice two months, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  So long? Nay, then, let the devil wear black,\\nfor I\\'ll have a suit of sables. O heavens, die two\\nmonths ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there\\'s\\nhope a great man\\'s memory may outlive his life half\\na year. But, by \\'r Lady, he must build churches, then,\\nor else shall he suffer not thinking on, with the\\nhobby-horse, whose epitaph is \"For oh, for oh, the\\nhobby-horse is forgot.\"\\n[The trumpets sounds.

Soft, now to my mother.\\nO heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever\\nThe soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.\\nLet me be cruel, not unnatural.\\nI will speak daggers to her, but use none.\\nMy tongue and soul in this be hypocrites:\\nHow in my words somever she be shent,\\nTo give them seals never, my soul, consent.\\n[He exits.]\\n\\nScene 3\\n=======\\n[Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.]\\n\\n\\nKING\\nI like him not, nor stands it safe with us\\nTo let his madness range. Therefore prepare you.\\nI your commission will forthwith dispatch,\\nAnd he to England shall along with you.\\nThe terms of our estate may not endure\\nHazard so near \\'s as doth hourly grow\\nOut of his brows.\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN  We will ourselves provide.\\nMost holy and religious fear it is\\nTo keep those many many bodies safe\\nThat live and feed upon your Majesty.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nThe single and peculiar life is bound\\nWith all the strength and armor of the mind\\nTo keep itself from noyance, but much more\\nThat spirit upon whose weal depends and rests\\nThe lives of many. The cess of majesty\\nDies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw\\nWhat\\'s near it with it; or it is a massy wheel\\nFixed on the summit of the highest mount,\\nTo whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things\\nAre mortised and adjoined, which, when it falls,\\nEach small annexment, petty consequence,\\nAttends the boist\\'rous ruin. Never alone\\nDid the king sigh, but with a general groan.\\n\\nKING\\nArm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage,\\nFor we will fetters put about this fear,\\nWhich now goes too free-footed.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  We will haste us.\\n[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern exit.]\\n\\n[Enter Polonius.]\\n\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nMy lord, he\\'s going to his mother\\'s closet.\\nBehind the arras I\\'ll convey myself\\nTo hear the process. I\\'ll warrant she\\'ll tax him\\nhome;\\nAnd, as you said (and wisely was it said),\\n\\'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,\\nSince nature makes them partial, should o\\'erhear\\nThe speech of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.\\nI\\'ll call upon you ere you go to bed\\nAnd tell you what I know.\\n\\nKING  Thanks, dear my lord.\\n[Polonius exits.]\\nO, my offense is rank, it smells to heaven;\\nIt hath the primal eldest curse upon \\'t,\\nA brother\\'s murder. Pray can I not,\\nThough inclination be as sharp as will.\\nMy stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,\\nAnd, like a man to double business bound,\\nI stand in pause where I shall first begin\\nAnd both neglect. What if this cursed hand\\nWere thicker than itself with brother\\'s blood?\\nIs there not rain enough in the sweet heavens\\nTo wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy\\nBut to confront the visage of offense?\\nAnd what\\'s in prayer but this twofold force,\\nTo be forestalled ere we come to fall,\\nOr pardoned being down? Then I\\'ll look up.\\nMy fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer\\nCan serve my turn? \"Forgive me my foul murder\"?\\nThat cannot be, since I am still possessed\\nOf those effects for which I did the murder:\\nMy crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.\\nMay one be pardoned and retain th\\' offense?\\nIn the corrupted currents of this world,\\nOffense\\'s gilded hand may shove by justice,\\nAnd oft \\'tis seen the wicked prize itself\\nBuys out the law. But \\'tis not so above:\\nThere is no shuffling; there the action lies\\nIn his true nature, and we ourselves compelled,\\nEven to the teeth and forehead of our faults,\\nTo give in evidence. What then? What rests?\\nTry what repentance can. What can it not?\\nYet what can it, when one cannot repent?\\nO wretched state! O bosom black as death!\\nO limed soul, that, struggling to be free,\\nArt more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay.\\nBow, stubborn knees, and heart with strings of steel\\nBe soft as sinews of the newborn babe.\\nAll may be well.\\t[He kneels.]\\n\\n[Enter Hamlet.]\\n\\n\\nHAMLET\\nNow might I do it pat, now he is a-praying,\\nAnd now I\\'ll do \\'t.\\t[He draws his sword.]\\nAnd so he goes to heaven,\\nAnd so am I revenged. That would be scanned:\\nA villain kills my father, and for that,\\nI, his sole son, do this same villain send\\nTo heaven.\\nWhy, this is hire and salary, not revenge.\\nHe took my father grossly, full of bread,\\nWith all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;\\nAnd how his audit stands who knows save heaven.\\nBut in our circumstance and course of thought\\n\\'Tis heavy with him. And am I then revenged\\nTo take him in the purging of his soul,\\nWhen he is fit and seasoned for his passage?\\nNo.\\nUp sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.\\n[He sheathes his sword.]\\nWhen he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,\\nOr in th\\' incestuous pleasure of his bed,\\nAt game, a-swearing, or about some act\\nThat has no relish of salvation in \\'t--\\nThen trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,\\nAnd that his soul may be as damned and black\\nAs hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.\\nThis physic but prolongs thy sickly days.\\n[Hamlet exits.]\\n\\nKING, [rising]\\nMy words fly up, my thoughts remain below;\\nWords without thoughts never to heaven go.\\n[He exits.]\\n\\nScene 4\\n=======\\n[Enter Queen and Polonius.]\\n\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nHe will come straight. Look you lay home to him.\\nTell him his pranks have been too broad to bear\\nwith\\nAnd that your Grace hath screened and stood\\nbetween\\nMuch heat and him. I\\'ll silence me even here.\\nPray you, be round with him.\\n\\nHAMLET, [within]  Mother, mother, mother!\\n\\nQUEEN  I\\'ll warrant you. Fear me not. Withdraw,\\nI hear him coming.\\n[Polonius hides behind the arras.]\\n\\n[Enter Hamlet.]\\n\\n\\nHAMLET  Now, mother, what\\'s the matter?\\n\\nQUEEN\\nHamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nMother, you have my father much offended.\\n\\nQUEEN\\nCome, come, you answer with an idle tongue.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nGo, go, you question with a wicked tongue.\\n\\nQUEEN\\nWhy, how now, Hamlet?\\n\\nHAMLET  What\\'s the matter now?\\n\\nQUEEN\\nHave you forgot me?\\n\\nHAMLET  No, by the rood, not so.\\nYou are the Queen, your husband\\'s brother\\'s wife,\\nAnd (would it were not so) you are my mother.\\n\\nQUEEN\\nNay, then I\\'ll set those to you that can speak.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nCome, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge.\\nYou go not till I set you up a glass\\nWhere you may see the inmost part of you.\\n\\nQUEEN\\nWhat wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murder me?\\nHelp, ho!\\n\\nPOLONIUS, [behind the arras]  What ho! Help!\\n\\nHAMLET\\nHow now, a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead.\\n[He kills Polonius by thrusting a rapier\\nthrough the arras.]\\n\\nPOLONIUS, [behind the arras]\\nO, I am slain!\\n\\nQUEEN  O me, what hast thou done?\\n\\nHAMLET  Nay, I know not. Is it the King?\\n\\nQUEEN\\nO, what a rash and bloody deed is this!\\n\\nHAMLET\\nA bloody deed--almost as bad, good mother,\\nAs kill a king and marry with his brother.\\n\\nQUEEN\\nAs kill a king?\\n\\nHAMLET  Ay, lady, it was my word.\\n[He pulls Polonius\\' body from behind the arras.]\\nThou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell.\\nI took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.\\nThou find\\'st to be too busy is some danger.\\n[To Queen.] Leave wringing of your hands. Peace, sit\\nyou down,\\nAnd let me wring your heart; for so I shall\\nIf it be made of penetrable stuff,\\nIf damned custom have not brazed it so\\nThat it be proof and bulwark against sense.\\n\\nQUEEN\\nWhat have I done, that thou dar\\'st wag thy tongue\\nIn noise so rude against me?\\n\\nHAMLET  Such an act\\nThat blurs the grace and blush of modesty,\\nCalls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose\\nFrom the fair forehead of an innocent love\\nAnd sets a blister there, makes marriage vows\\nAs false as dicers\\' oaths--O, such a deed\\nAs from the body of contraction plucks\\nThe very soul, and sweet religion makes\\nA rhapsody of words! Heaven\\'s face does glow\\nO\\'er this solidity and compound mass\\nWith heated visage, as against the doom,\\nIs thought-sick at the act.\\n\\nQUEEN  Ay me, what act\\nThat roars so loud and thunders in the index?\\n\\nHAMLET\\nLook here upon this picture and on this,\\nThe counterfeit presentment of two brothers.\\nSee what a grace was seated on this brow,\\nHyperion\\'s curls, the front of Jove himself,\\nAn eye like Mars\\' to threaten and command,\\nA station like the herald Mercury\\nNew-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill,\\nA combination and a form indeed\\nWhere every god did seem to set his seal\\nTo give the world assurance of a man.\\nThis was your husband. Look you now what follows.\\nHere is your husband, like a mildewed ear\\nBlasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?\\nCould you on this fair mountain leave to feed\\nAnd batten on this moor? Ha! Have you eyes?\\nYou cannot call it love, for at your age\\nThe heyday in the blood is tame, it\\'s humble\\nAnd waits upon the judgment; and what judgment\\nWould step from this to this? Sense sure you have,\\nElse could you not have motion; but sure that sense\\nIs apoplexed; for madness would not err,\\nNor sense to ecstasy was ne\\'er so thralled,\\nBut it reserved some quantity of choice\\nTo serve in such a difference. What devil was \\'t\\nThat thus hath cozened you at hoodman-blind?\\nEyes without feeling, feeling without sight,\\nEars without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,\\nOr but a sickly part of one true sense\\nCould not so mope. O shame, where is thy blush?\\nRebellious hell,\\nIf thou canst mutine in a matron\\'s bones,\\nTo flaming youth let virtue be as wax\\nAnd melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame\\nWhen the compulsive ardor gives the charge,\\nSince frost itself as actively doth burn,\\nAnd reason panders will.\\n\\nQUEEN  O Hamlet, speak no more!\\nThou turn\\'st my eyes into my very soul,\\nAnd there I see such black and grained spots\\nAs will not leave their tinct.\\n\\nHAMLET  Nay, but to live\\nIn the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,\\nStewed in corruption, honeying and making love\\nOver the nasty sty!\\n\\nQUEEN  O, speak to me no more!\\nThese words like daggers enter in my ears.\\nNo more, sweet Hamlet!\\n\\nHAMLET  A murderer and a villain,\\nA slave that is not twentieth part the tithe\\nOf your precedent lord; a vice of kings,\\nA cutpurse of the empire and the rule,\\nThat from a shelf the precious diadem stole\\nAnd put it in his pocket--\\n\\nQUEEN  No more!\\n\\nHAMLET  A king of shreds and patches--\\n\\n[Enter Ghost.]\\n\\nSave me and hover o\\'er me with your wings,\\nYou heavenly guards!--What would your gracious\\nfigure?\\n\\nQUEEN  Alas, he\\'s mad.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nDo you not come your tardy son to chide,\\nThat, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by\\nTh\\' important acting of your dread command?\\nO, say!\\n\\nGHOST  Do not forget. This visitation\\nIs but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.\\nBut look, amazement on thy mother sits.\\nO, step between her and her fighting soul.\\nConceit in weakest bodies strongest works.\\nSpeak to her, Hamlet.\\n\\nHAMLET  How is it with you, lady?\\n\\nQUEEN  Alas, how is \\'t with you,\\nThat you do bend your eye on vacancy\\nAnd with th\\' incorporal air do hold discourse?\\nForth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep,\\nAnd, as the sleeping soldiers in th\\' alarm,\\nYour bedded hair, like life in excrements,\\nStart up and stand an end. O gentle son,\\nUpon the heat and flame of thy distemper\\nSprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?\\n\\nHAMLET\\nOn him, on him! Look you how pale he glares.\\nHis form and cause conjoined, preaching to stones,\\nWould make them capable. [To the Ghost.] Do not\\nlook upon me,\\nLest with this piteous action you convert\\nMy stern effects. Then what I have to do\\nWill want true color--tears perchance for blood.\\n\\nQUEEN  To whom do you speak this?\\n\\nHAMLET  Do you see nothing there?\\n\\nQUEEN\\nNothing at all; yet all that is I see.\\n\\nHAMLET  Nor did you nothing hear?\\n\\nQUEEN  No, nothing but ourselves.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nWhy, look you there, look how it steals away!\\nMy father, in his habit as he lived!\\nLook where he goes even now out at the portal!\\n[Ghost exits.]\\n\\nQUEEN\\nThis is the very coinage of your brain.\\nThis bodiless creation ecstasy\\nIs very cunning in.\\n\\nHAMLET  Ecstasy?\\nMy pulse as yours doth temperately keep time\\nAnd makes as healthful music. It is not madness\\nThat I have uttered. Bring me to the test,\\nAnd I the matter will reword, which madness\\nWould gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,\\nLay not that flattering unction to your soul\\nThat not your trespass but my madness speaks.\\nIt will but skin and film the ulcerous place,\\nWhiles rank corruption, mining all within,\\nInfects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven,\\nRepent what\\'s past, avoid what is to come,\\nAnd do not spread the compost on the weeds\\nTo make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue,\\nFor, in the fatness of these pursy times,\\nVirtue itself of vice must pardon beg,\\nYea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.\\n\\nQUEEN\\nO Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain!\\n\\nHAMLET\\nO, throw away the worser part of it,\\nAnd live the purer with the other half!\\nGood night. But go not to my uncle\\'s bed.\\nAssume a virtue if you have it not.\\nThat monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,\\nOf habits devil, is angel yet in this,\\nThat to the use of actions fair and good\\nHe likewise gives a frock or livery\\nThat aptly is put on. Refrain tonight,\\nAnd that shall lend a kind of easiness\\nTo the next abstinence, the next more easy;\\nFor use almost can change the stamp of nature\\nAnd either ... the devil or throw him out\\nWith wondrous potency. Once more, good night,\\nAnd, when you are desirous to be blest,\\nI\\'ll blessing beg of you. For this same lord\\n[Pointing to Polonius.]\\nI do repent; but heaven hath pleased it so\\nTo punish me with this and this with me,\\nThat I must be their scourge and minister.\\nI will bestow him and will answer well\\nThe death I gave him. So, again, good night.\\nI must be cruel only to be kind.\\nThis bad begins, and worse remains behind.\\nOne word more, good lady.\\n\\nQUEEN  What shall I do?\\n\\nHAMLET\\nNot this by no means that I bid you do:\\nLet the bloat king tempt you again to bed,\\nPinch wanton on your cheek, call you his mouse,\\nAnd let him, for a pair of reechy kisses\\nOr paddling in your neck with his damned fingers,\\nMake you to ravel all this matter out\\nThat I essentially am not in madness,\\nBut mad in craft. \\'Twere good you let him know,\\nFor who that\\'s but a queen, fair, sober, wise,\\nWould from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,\\nSuch dear concernings hide? Who would do so?\\nNo, in despite of sense and secrecy,\\nUnpeg the basket on the house\\'s top,\\nLet the birds fly, and like the famous ape,\\nTo try conclusions, in the basket creep\\nAnd break your own neck down.\\n\\nQUEEN\\nBe thou assured, if words be made of breath\\nAnd breath of life, I have no life to breathe\\nWhat thou hast said to me.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nI must to England, you know that.\\n\\nQUEEN  Alack,\\nI had forgot! \\'Tis so concluded on.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nThere\\'s letters sealed; and my two schoolfellows,\\nWhom I will trust as I will adders fanged,\\nThey bear the mandate; they must sweep my way\\nAnd marshal me to knavery. Let it work,\\nFor \\'tis the sport to have the enginer\\nHoist with his own petard; and \\'t shall go hard\\nBut I will delve one yard below their mines\\nAnd blow them at the moon. O, \\'tis most sweet\\nWhen in one line two crafts directly meet.\\nThis man shall set me packing.\\nI\\'ll lug the guts into the neighbor room.\\nMother, good night indeed. This counselor\\nIs now most still, most secret, and most grave,\\nWho was in life a foolish prating knave.--\\nCome, sir, to draw toward an end with you.--\\nGood night, mother.\\n[They exit, Hamlet tugging in Polonius.]\\n\\n\\nACT 4\\n=====\\n\\nScene 1\\n=======\\n[Enter King and Queen, with Rosencrantz and\\nGuildenstern.]\\n\\n\\nKING\\nThere\\'s matter in these sighs; these profound heaves\\nYou must translate; \\'tis fit we understand them.\\nWhere is your son?\\n\\nQUEEN\\nBestow this place on us a little while.\\n[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern exit.]\\nAh, mine own lord, what have I seen tonight!\\n\\nKING  What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?\\n\\nQUEEN\\nMad as the sea and wind when both contend\\nWhich is the mightier. In his lawless fit,\\nBehind the arras hearing something stir,\\nWhips out his rapier, cries \"A rat, a rat,\"\\nAnd in this brainish apprehension kills\\nThe unseen good old man.\\n\\nKING  O heavy deed!\\nIt had been so with us, had we been there.\\nHis liberty is full of threats to all--\\nTo you yourself, to us, to everyone.\\nAlas, how shall this bloody deed be answered?\\nIt will be laid to us, whose providence\\nShould have kept short, restrained, and out of haunt\\nThis mad young man. But so much was our love,\\nWe would not understand what was most fit,\\nBut, like the owner of a foul disease,\\nTo keep it from divulging, let it feed\\nEven on the pith of life. Where is he gone?\\n\\nQUEEN\\nTo draw apart the body he hath killed,\\nO\\'er whom his very madness, like some ore\\nAmong a mineral of metals base,\\nShows itself pure: he weeps for what is done.\\n\\nKING  O Gertrude, come away!\\nThe sun no sooner shall the mountains touch\\nBut we will ship him hence; and this vile deed\\nWe must with all our majesty and skill\\nBoth countenance and excuse.--Ho, Guildenstern!\\n\\n[Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]\\n\\nFriends both, go join you with some further aid.\\nHamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,\\nAnd from his mother\\'s closet hath he dragged him.\\nGo seek him out, speak fair, and bring the body\\nInto the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.\\n[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern exit.]\\nCome, Gertrude, we\\'ll call up our wisest friends\\nAnd let them know both what we mean to do\\nAnd what\\'s untimely done. ...\\nWhose whisper o\\'er the world\\'s diameter,\\nAs level as the cannon to his blank\\nTransports his poisoned shot, may miss our name\\nAnd hit the woundless air. O, come away!\\nMy soul is full of discord and dismay.\\n[They exit.]\\n\\nScene 2\\n=======\\n[Enter Hamlet.]\\n\\n\\nHAMLET  Safely stowed.\\n\\nGENTLEMEN, [within]  Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!\\n\\nHAMLET  But soft, what noise? Who calls on Hamlet?\\nO, here they come.\\n\\n[Enter Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and others.]\\n\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nWhat have you done, my lord, with the dead body?\\n\\nHAMLET\\nCompounded it with dust, whereto \\'tis kin.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nTell us where \\'tis, that we may take it thence\\nAnd bear it to the chapel.\\n\\nHAMLET  Do not believe it.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Believe what?\\n\\nHAMLET  That I can keep your counsel and not mine\\nown. Besides, to be demanded of a sponge, what\\nreplication should be made by the son of a king?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Take you me for a sponge, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  Ay, sir, that soaks up the King\\'s countenance,\\nhis rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the\\nKing best service in the end. He keeps them like an\\nape an apple in the corner of his jaw, first mouthed,\\nto be last swallowed. When he needs what you have\\ngleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you\\nshall be dry again.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  I understand you not, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a\\nfoolish ear.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  My lord, you must tell us where the\\nbody is and go with us to the King.\\n\\nHAMLET  The body is with the King, but the King is not\\nwith the body.

Hide fox, and\\nall after!\\n[They exit.]\\n\\nScene 3\\n=======\\n[Enter King and two or three.]\\n\\n\\nKING\\nI have sent to seek him and to find the body.\\nHow dangerous is it that this man goes loose!\\nYet must not we put the strong law on him.\\nHe\\'s loved of the distracted multitude,\\nWho like not in their judgment, but their eyes;\\nAnd, where \\'tis so, th\\' offender\\'s scourge is weighed,\\nBut never the offense. To bear all smooth and even,\\nThis sudden sending him away must seem\\nDeliberate pause.

Bring in the lord.\\n\\n[They enter with Hamlet.]\\n\\n\\nKING  Now, Hamlet, where\\'s Polonius?\\n\\nHAMLET  At supper.\\n\\nKING  At supper where?\\n\\nHAMLET  Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A\\ncertain convocation of politic worms are e\\'en at\\nhim. Your worm is your only emperor for diet. We\\nfat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves\\nfor maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar is\\nbut variable service--two dishes but to one table.\\nThat\\'s the end.\\n\\nKING  Alas, alas!\\n\\nHAMLET  A man may fish with the worm that hath eat\\nof a king and eat of the fish that hath fed of that\\nworm.\\n\\nKING  What dost thou mean by this?\\n\\nHAMLET  Nothing but to show you how a king may go a\\nprogress through the guts of a beggar.\\n\\nKING  Where is Polonius?\\n\\nHAMLET  In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger\\nfind him not there, seek him i\\' th\\' other\\nplace yourself. But if, indeed, you find him not\\nwithin this month, you shall nose him as you go up\\nthe stairs into the lobby.\\n\\nKING, [to Attendants.]  Go, seek him there.\\n\\nHAMLET  He will stay till you come.\\t[Attendants exit.]\\n\\nKING\\nHamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety\\n(Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve\\nFor that which thou hast done) must send thee\\nhence\\nWith fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.\\nThe bark is ready, and the wind at help,\\nTh\\' associates tend, and everything is bent\\nFor England.\\n\\nHAMLET  For England?\\n\\nKING  Ay, Hamlet.\\n\\nHAMLET  Good.\\n\\nKING\\nSo is it, if thou knew\\'st our purposes.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nI see a cherub that sees them. But come, for\\nEngland.\\nFarewell, dear mother.\\n\\nKING  Thy loving father, Hamlet.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nMy mother. Father and mother is man and wife,\\nMan and wife is one flesh, and so, my mother.--\\nCome, for England.\\t[He exits.]\\n\\nKING\\nFollow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.\\nDelay it not. I\\'ll have him hence tonight.\\nAway, for everything is sealed and done\\nThat else leans on th\\' affair. Pray you, make haste.\\n[All but the King exit.]\\nAnd England, if my love thou hold\\'st at aught\\n(As my great power thereof may give thee sense,\\nSince yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red\\nAfter the Danish sword, and thy free awe\\nPays homage to us), thou mayst not coldly set\\nOur sovereign process, which imports at full,\\nBy letters congruing to that effect,\\nThe present death of Hamlet. Do it, England,\\nFor like the hectic in my blood he rages,\\nAnd thou must cure me. Till I know \\'tis done,\\nHowe\\'er my haps, my joys will ne\\'er begin.\\n[He exits.]\\n\\nScene 4\\n=======\\n[Enter Fortinbras with his army over the stage.]\\n\\n\\nFORTINBRAS\\nGo, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.\\nTell him that by his license Fortinbras\\nCraves the conveyance of a promised march\\nOver his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.\\nIf that his Majesty would aught with us,\\nWe shall express our duty in his eye;\\nAnd let him know so.\\n\\nCAPTAIN  I will do \\'t, my lord.\\n\\nFORTINBRAS  Go softly on.\\t[All but the Captain exit.]\\n\\n[Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and others.]\\n\\n\\nHAMLET  Good sir, whose powers are these?\\n\\nCAPTAIN  They are of Norway, sir.\\n\\nHAMLET  How purposed, sir, I pray you?\\n\\nCAPTAIN  Against some part of Poland.\\n\\nHAMLET  Who commands them, sir?\\n\\nCAPTAIN\\nThe nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nGoes it against the main of Poland, sir,\\nOr for some frontier?\\n\\nCAPTAIN\\nTruly to speak, and with no addition,\\nWe go to gain a little patch of ground\\nThat hath in it no profit but the name.\\nTo pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;\\nNor will it yield to Norway or the Pole\\nA ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nWhy, then, the Polack never will defend it.\\n\\nCAPTAIN\\nYes, it is already garrisoned.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nTwo thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats\\nWill not debate the question of this straw.\\nThis is th\\' impostume of much wealth and peace,\\nThat inward breaks and shows no cause without\\nWhy the man dies.--I humbly thank you, sir.\\n\\nCAPTAIN  God be wi\\' you, sir.\\t[He exits.]\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Will \\'t please you go, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET\\nI\\'ll be with you straight. Go a little before.\\n[All but Hamlet exit.]\\nHow all occasions do inform against me\\nAnd spur my dull revenge. What is a man\\nIf his chief good and market of his time\\nBe but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.\\nSure He that made us with such large discourse,\\nLooking before and after, gave us not\\nThat capability and godlike reason\\nTo fust in us unused. Now whether it be\\nBestial oblivion or some craven scruple\\nOf thinking too precisely on th\\' event\\n(A thought which, quartered, hath but one part\\nwisdom\\nAnd ever three parts coward), I do not know\\nWhy yet I live to say \"This thing\\'s to do,\"\\nSith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means\\nTo do \\'t. Examples gross as Earth exhort me:\\nWitness this army of such mass and charge,\\nLed by a delicate and tender prince,\\nWhose spirit with divine ambition puffed\\nMakes mouths at the invisible event,\\nExposing what is mortal and unsure\\nTo all that fortune, death, and danger dare,\\nEven for an eggshell. Rightly to be great\\nIs not to stir without great argument,\\nBut greatly to find quarrel in a straw\\nWhen honor\\'s at the stake.

They have letters for him. Ere we were two days\\nold at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave\\nus chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on\\na compelled valor, and in the grapple I boarded them.\\nOn the instant, they got clear of our ship; so I alone\\nbecame their prisoner. They have dealt with me like\\nthieves of mercy, but they knew what they did: I am to\\ndo a good turn for them. Let the King have the letters\\nI have sent, and repair thou to me with as much speed\\nas thou wouldst fly death. I have words to speak in\\nthine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too\\nlight for the bore of the matter. These good fellows\\nwill bring thee where I am.

Farewell.\\nHe that thou knowest thine,\\nHamlet.\\nCome, I will give you way for these your letters\\nAnd do \\'t the speedier that you may direct me\\nTo him from whom you brought them.\\n[They exit.]\\n\\nScene 7\\n=======\\n[Enter King and Laertes.]\\n\\n\\nKING\\nNow must your conscience my acquittance seal,\\nAnd you must put me in your heart for friend,\\nSith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,\\nThat he which hath your noble father slain\\nPursued my life.\\n\\nLAERTES  It well appears. But tell me\\nWhy you proceeded not against these feats,\\nSo criminal and so capital in nature,\\nAs by your safety, greatness, wisdom, all things else,\\nYou mainly were stirred up.\\n\\nKING  O, for two special reasons,\\nWhich may to you perhaps seem much unsinewed,\\nBut yet to me they\\'re strong. The Queen his mother\\nLives almost by his looks, and for myself\\n(My virtue or my plague, be it either which),\\nShe is so conjunctive to my life and soul\\nThat, as the star moves not but in his sphere,\\nI could not but by her. The other motive\\nWhy to a public count I might not go\\nIs the great love the general gender bear him,\\nWho, dipping all his faults in their affection,\\nWork like the spring that turneth wood to stone,\\nConvert his gyves to graces, so that my arrows,\\nToo slightly timbered for so loud a wind,\\nWould have reverted to my bow again,\\nBut not where I have aimed them.\\n\\nLAERTES\\nAnd so have I a noble father lost,\\nA sister driven into desp\\'rate terms,\\nWhose worth, if praises may go back again,\\nStood challenger on mount of all the age\\nFor her perfections. But my revenge will come.\\n\\nKING\\nBreak not your sleeps for that. You must not think\\nThat we are made of stuff so flat and dull\\nThat we can let our beard be shook with danger\\nAnd think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.\\nI loved your father, and we love ourself,\\nAnd that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--\\n\\n[Enter a Messenger with letters.]\\n\\nHow now? What news?\\n\\nMESSENGER  Letters, my lord, from\\nHamlet.\\nThese to your Majesty, this to the Queen.\\n\\nKING  From Hamlet? Who brought them?\\n\\nMESSENGER\\nSailors, my lord, they say. I saw them not.\\nThey were given me by Claudio. He received them\\nOf him that brought them.\\n\\nKING  Laertes, you shall hear\\nthem.--\\nLeave us.\\t[Messenger exits.]\\n[Reads.] High and mighty, you shall know I am set\\nnaked on your kingdom. Tomorrow shall I beg leave to\\nsee your kingly eyes, when I shall (first asking your\\npardon) thereunto recount the occasion of my sudden\\nand more strange return. Hamlet.\\nWhat should this mean? Are all the rest come back?\\nOr is it some abuse and no such thing?\\n\\nLAERTES  Know you the hand?\\n\\nKING  \\'Tis Hamlet\\'s character. \"Naked\"--\\nAnd in a postscript here, he says \"alone.\"\\nCan you advise me?\\n\\nLAERTES\\nI am lost in it, my lord. But let him come.\\nIt warms the very sickness in my heart\\nThat I shall live and tell him to his teeth\\n\"Thus didst thou.\"\\n\\nKING  If it be so, Laertes\\n(As how should it be so? how otherwise?),\\nWill you be ruled by me?\\n\\nLAERTES  Ay, my lord,\\nSo you will not o\\'errule me to a peace.\\n\\nKING\\nTo thine own peace. If he be now returned,\\nAs checking at his voyage, and that he means\\nNo more to undertake it, I will work him\\nTo an exploit, now ripe in my device,\\nUnder the which he shall not choose but fall;\\nAnd for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,\\nBut even his mother shall uncharge the practice\\nAnd call it accident.\\n\\nLAERTES  My lord, I will be ruled,\\nThe rather if you could devise it so\\nThat I might be the organ.\\n\\nKING  It falls right.\\nYou have been talked of since your travel much,\\nAnd that in Hamlet\\'s hearing, for a quality\\nWherein they say you shine. Your sum of parts\\nDid not together pluck such envy from him\\nAs did that one, and that, in my regard,\\nOf the unworthiest siege.\\n\\nLAERTES  What part is that, my lord?\\n\\nKING\\nA very ribbon in the cap of youth--\\nYet needful too, for youth no less becomes\\nThe light and careless livery that it wears\\nThan settled age his sables and his weeds,\\nImporting health and graveness. Two months since\\nHere was a gentleman of Normandy.\\nI have seen myself, and served against, the French,\\nAnd they can well on horseback, but this gallant\\nHad witchcraft in \\'t. He grew unto his seat,\\nAnd to such wondrous doing brought his horse\\nAs had he been encorpsed and demi-natured\\nWith the brave beast. So far he topped my thought\\nThat I in forgery of shapes and tricks\\nCome short of what he did.\\n\\nLAERTES  A Norman was \\'t?\\n\\nKING  A Norman.\\n\\nLAERTES\\nUpon my life, Lamord.\\n\\nKING  The very same.\\n\\nLAERTES\\nI know him well. He is the brooch indeed\\nAnd gem of all the nation.\\n\\nKING  He made confession of you\\nAnd gave you such a masterly report\\nFor art and exercise in your defense,\\nAnd for your rapier most especial,\\nThat he cried out \\'twould be a sight indeed\\nIf one could match you. The \\'scrimers of their\\nnation\\nHe swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,\\nIf you opposed them. Sir, this report of his\\nDid Hamlet so envenom with his envy\\nThat he could nothing do but wish and beg\\nYour sudden coming-o\\'er, to play with you.\\nNow out of this--\\n\\nLAERTES  What out of this, my lord?\\n\\nKING\\nLaertes, was your father dear to you?\\nOr are you like the painting of a sorrow,\\nA face without a heart?\\n\\nLAERTES  Why ask you this?\\n\\nKING\\nNot that I think you did not love your father,\\nBut that I know love is begun by time\\nAnd that I see, in passages of proof,\\nTime qualifies the spark and fire of it.\\nThere lives within the very flame of love\\nA kind of wick or snuff that will abate it,\\nAnd nothing is at a like goodness still;\\nFor goodness, growing to a pleurisy,\\nDies in his own too-much. That we would do\\nWe should do when we would; for this \"would\"\\nchanges\\nAnd hath abatements and delays as many\\nAs there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;\\nAnd then this \"should\" is like a spendthrift sigh,\\nThat hurts by easing. But to the quick of th\\' ulcer:\\nHamlet comes back; what would you undertake\\nTo show yourself indeed your father\\'s son\\nMore than in words?\\n\\nLAERTES  To cut his throat i\\' th\\' church.\\n\\nKING\\nNo place indeed should murder sanctuarize;\\nRevenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,\\nWill you do this? Keep close within your chamber.\\nHamlet, returned, shall know you are come home.\\nWe\\'ll put on those shall praise your excellence\\nAnd set a double varnish on the fame\\nThe Frenchman gave you; bring you, in fine,\\ntogether\\nAnd wager on your heads. He, being remiss,\\nMost generous, and free from all contriving,\\nWill not peruse the foils, so that with ease,\\nOr with a little shuffling, you may choose\\nA sword unbated, and in a pass of practice\\nRequite him for your father.\\n\\nLAERTES  I will do \\'t,\\nAnd for that purpose I\\'ll anoint my sword.\\nI bought an unction of a mountebank\\nSo mortal that, but dip a knife in it,\\nWhere it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,\\nCollected from all simples that have virtue\\nUnder the moon, can save the thing from death\\nThat is but scratched withal. I\\'ll touch my point\\nWith this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,\\nIt may be death.\\n\\nKING  Let\\'s further think of this,\\nWeigh what convenience both of time and means\\nMay fit us to our shape. If this should fail,\\nAnd that our drift look through our bad\\nperformance,\\n\\'Twere better not assayed. Therefore this project\\nShould have a back or second that might hold\\nIf this did blast in proof. Soft, let me see.\\nWe\\'ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings--\\nI ha \\'t!\\nWhen in your motion you are hot and dry\\n(As make your bouts more violent to that end)\\nAnd that he calls for drink, I\\'ll have prepared\\nhim\\nA chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,\\nIf he by chance escape your venomed stuck,\\nOur purpose may hold there.--But stay, what\\nnoise?\\n\\n[Enter Queen.]\\n\\n\\nQUEEN\\nOne woe doth tread upon another\\'s heel,\\nSo fast they follow. Your sister\\'s drowned, Laertes.\\n\\nLAERTES  Drowned? O, where?\\n\\nQUEEN\\nThere is a willow grows askant the brook\\nThat shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.\\nTherewith fantastic garlands did she make\\nOf crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,\\nThat liberal shepherds give a grosser name,\\nBut our cold maids do \"dead men\\'s fingers\" call\\nthem.\\nThere on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds\\nClamb\\'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,\\nWhen down her weedy trophies and herself\\nFell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide,\\nAnd mermaid-like awhile they bore her up,\\nWhich time she chanted snatches of old lauds,\\nAs one incapable of her own distress\\nOr like a creature native and endued\\nUnto that element. But long it could not be\\nTill that her garments, heavy with their drink,\\nPulled the poor wretch from her melodious lay\\nTo muddy death.\\n\\nLAERTES  Alas, then she is drowned.\\n\\nQUEEN  Drowned, drowned.\\n\\nLAERTES\\nToo much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,\\nAnd therefore I forbid my tears. But yet\\nIt is our trick; nature her custom holds,\\nLet shame say what it will. When these are gone,\\nThe woman will be out.--Adieu, my lord.\\nI have a speech o\\' fire that fain would blaze,\\nBut that this folly drowns it.\\t[He exits.]\\n\\nKING  Let\\'s follow, Gertrude.\\nHow much I had to do to calm his rage!\\nNow fear I this will give it start again.\\nTherefore, let\\'s follow.\\n[They exit.]\\n\\n\\nACT 5\\n=====\\n\\nScene 1\\n=======\\n[Enter Gravedigger and Another.]\\n\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  Is she to be buried in Christian burial,\\nwhen she willfully seeks her own salvation?\\n\\nOTHER  I tell thee she is. Therefore make her grave\\nstraight. The crowner hath sat on her and finds it\\nChristian burial.\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  How can that be, unless she drowned\\nherself in her own defense?\\n\\nOTHER  Why, \\'tis found so.\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  It must be se offendendo; it cannot be\\nelse. For here lies the point: if I drown myself\\nwittingly, it argues an act, and an act hath three\\nbranches--it is to act, to do, to perform. Argal, she\\ndrowned herself wittingly.\\n\\nOTHER  Nay, but hear you, goodman delver--\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  Give me leave. Here lies the water;\\ngood. Here stands the man; good. If the man go to\\nthis water and drown himself, it is (will he, nill he)\\nhe goes; mark you that. But if the water come to him\\nand drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he\\nthat is not guilty of his own death shortens not his\\nown life.\\n\\nOTHER  But is this law?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  Ay, marry, is \\'t--crowner\\'s \\'quest law.\\n\\nOTHER  Will you ha\\' the truth on \\'t?

And the more\\npity that great folk should have count\\'nance in this\\nworld to drown or hang themselves more than\\ntheir even-Christian. Come, my spade.

Hum, this fellow might\\nbe in \\'s time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,\\nhis recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,\\nhis recoveries. Is this the fine of his fines and the\\nrecovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full\\nof fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more\\nof his purchases, and double ones too, than the\\nlength and breadth of a pair of indentures? The very\\nconveyances of his lands will scarcely lie in this box,\\nand must th\\' inheritor himself have no more, ha?\\n\\nHORATIO  Not a jot more, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  Is not parchment made of sheepskins?\\n\\nHORATIO  Ay, my lord, and of calves\\' skins too.\\n\\nHAMLET  They are sheep and calves which seek out\\nassurance in that. I will speak to this fellow.--\\nWhose grave\\'s this, sirrah?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  Mine, sir.\\n[Sings.]\\tO, a pit of clay for to be made\\n\\tFor such a guest is meet.\\n\\nHAMLET  I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in \\'t.\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  You lie out on \\'t, sir, and therefore \\'tis\\nnot yours. For my part, I do not lie in \\'t, yet it is\\nmine.\\n\\nHAMLET  Thou dost lie in \\'t, to be in \\'t and say it is thine.\\n\\'Tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou\\nliest.\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  \\'Tis a quick lie, sir; \\'twill away again\\nfrom me to you.\\n\\nHAMLET  What man dost thou dig it for?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  For no man, sir.\\n\\nHAMLET  What woman then?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  For none, neither.\\n\\nHAMLET  Who is to be buried in \\'t?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  One that was a woman, sir, but, rest\\nher soul, she\\'s dead.\\n\\nHAMLET  How absolute the knave is! We must speak by\\nthe card, or equivocation will undo us. By the\\nLord, Horatio, this three years I have took note of\\nit: the age is grown so picked that the toe of the\\npeasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he\\ngalls his kibe.--How long hast thou been\\ngrave-maker?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  Of all the days i\\' th\\' year, I came to \\'t\\nthat day that our last King Hamlet overcame\\nFortinbras.\\n\\nHAMLET  How long is that since?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  Cannot you tell that? Every fool can\\ntell that. It was that very day that young Hamlet\\nwas born--he that is mad, and sent into England.\\n\\nHAMLET  Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  Why, because he was mad. He shall\\nrecover his wits there. Or if he do not, \\'tis no great\\nmatter there.\\n\\nHAMLET  Why?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  \\'Twill not be seen in him there. There\\nthe men are as mad as he.\\n\\nHAMLET  How came he mad?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  Very strangely, they say.\\n\\nHAMLET  How \"strangely\"?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  Faith, e\\'en with losing his wits.\\n\\nHAMLET  Upon what ground?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  Why, here in Denmark. I have been\\nsexton here, man and boy, thirty years.\\n\\nHAMLET  How long will a man lie i\\' th\\' earth ere he rot?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  Faith, if he be not rotten before he die\\n(as we have many pocky corses nowadays that will\\nscarce hold the laying in), he will last you some\\neight year or nine year. A tanner will last you nine\\nyear.\\n\\nHAMLET  Why he more than another?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his\\ntrade that he will keep out water a great while; and\\nyour water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead\\nbody. Here\\'s a skull now hath lien you i\\' th\\' earth\\nthree-and-twenty years.\\n\\nHAMLET  Whose was it?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  A whoreson mad fellow\\'s it was.\\nWhose do you think it was?\\n\\nHAMLET  Nay, I know not.\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  A pestilence on him for a mad rogue!\\nHe poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once.\\nThis same skull, sir, was, sir, Yorick\\'s skull, the\\nKing\\'s jester.\\n\\nHAMLET  This?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  E\\'en that.\\n\\nHAMLET, [taking the skull]  Let me see. Alas, poor\\nYorick! I knew him, Horatio--a fellow of infinite\\njest, of most excellent fancy. He hath bore me on his\\nback a thousand times, and now how abhorred in\\nmy imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung\\nthose lips that I have kissed I know not how oft.\\nWhere be your gibes now? your gambols? your\\nsongs? your flashes of merriment that were wont to\\nset the table on a roar? Not one now to mock your\\nown grinning? Quite chapfallen? Now get you to my\\nlady\\'s chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch\\nthick, to this favor she must come. Make her laugh\\nat that.--Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing.\\n\\nHORATIO  What\\'s that, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  Dost thou think Alexander looked o\\' this\\nfashion i\\' th\\' earth?\\n\\nHORATIO  E\\'en so.\\n\\nHAMLET  And smelt so? Pah!\\t[He puts the skull down.]\\n\\nHORATIO  E\\'en so, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  To what base uses we may return, Horatio!\\nWhy may not imagination trace the noble dust of\\nAlexander till he find it stopping a bunghole?\\n\\nHORATIO  \\'Twere to consider too curiously to consider\\nso.\\n\\nHAMLET  No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither,\\nwith modesty enough and likelihood to lead it, as\\nthus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander\\nreturneth to dust; the dust is earth; of earth\\nwe make loam; and why of that loam whereto he\\nwas converted might they not stop a beer barrel?\\nImperious Caesar, dead and turned to clay,\\nMight stop a hole to keep the wind away.\\nO, that that earth which kept the world in awe\\nShould patch a wall t\\' expel the winter\\'s flaw!\\n\\n[Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Lords attendant, and the\\ncorpse of Ophelia, with a Doctor of Divinity.]\\n\\nBut soft, but soft awhile! Here comes the King,\\nThe Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?\\nAnd with such maimed rites? This doth betoken\\nThe corse they follow did with desp\\'rate hand\\nFordo its own life. \\'Twas of some estate.\\nCouch we awhile and mark.\\t[They step aside.]\\n\\nLAERTES  What ceremony else?\\n\\nHAMLET  That is Laertes, a very noble youth. Mark.\\n\\nLAERTES  What ceremony else?\\n\\nDOCTOR\\nHer obsequies have been as far enlarged\\nAs we have warranty. Her death was doubtful,\\nAnd, but that great command o\\'ersways the order,\\nShe should in ground unsanctified been lodged\\nTill the last trumpet. For charitable prayers\\nShards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on\\nher.\\nYet here she is allowed her virgin crants,\\nHer maiden strewments, and the bringing home\\nOf bell and burial.\\n\\nLAERTES\\nMust there no more be done?\\n\\nDOCTOR  No more be done.\\nWe should profane the service of the dead\\nTo sing a requiem and such rest to her\\nAs to peace-parted souls.\\n\\nLAERTES  Lay her i\\' th\\' earth,\\nAnd from her fair and unpolluted flesh\\nMay violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,\\nA minist\\'ring angel shall my sister be\\nWhen thou liest howling.\\n\\nHAMLET, [to Horatio]  What, the fair Ophelia?\\n\\nQUEEN  Sweets to the sweet, farewell!\\n[She scatters flowers.]\\nI hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet\\'s wife;\\nI thought thy bride-bed to have decked, sweet maid,\\nAnd not have strewed thy grave.\\n\\nLAERTES  O, treble woe\\nFall ten times treble on that cursed head\\nWhose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense\\nDeprived thee of!--Hold off the earth awhile,\\nTill I have caught her once more in mine arms.\\n[Leaps in the grave.]\\nNow pile your dust upon the quick and dead,\\nTill of this flat a mountain you have made\\nT\\' o\\'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head\\nOf blue Olympus.\\n\\nHAMLET, [advancing]\\nWhat is he whose grief\\nBears such an emphasis, whose phrase of sorrow\\nConjures the wand\\'ring stars and makes them stand\\nLike wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,\\nHamlet the Dane.\\n\\nLAERTES, [coming out of the grave]\\nThe devil take thy soul!\\n\\nHAMLET  Thou pray\\'st not well.\\t[They grapple.]\\nI prithee take thy fingers from my throat,\\nFor though I am not splenitive and rash,\\nYet have I in me something dangerous,\\nWhich let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand.\\n\\nKING  Pluck them asunder.\\n\\nQUEEN  Hamlet! Hamlet!\\n\\nALL  Gentlemen!\\n\\nHORATIO  Good my lord, be quiet.\\n[Hamlet and Laertes are separated.]\\n\\nHAMLET\\nWhy, I will fight with him upon this theme\\nUntil my eyelids will no longer wag!\\n\\nQUEEN  O my son, what theme?\\n\\nHAMLET\\nI loved Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers\\nCould not with all their quantity of love\\nMake up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?\\n\\nKING  O, he is mad, Laertes!\\n\\nQUEEN  For love of God, forbear him.\\n\\nHAMLET  \\'Swounds, show me what thou \\'t do.\\nWoo\\'t weep, woo\\'t fight, woo\\'t fast, woo\\'t tear\\nthyself,\\nWoo\\'t drink up eisel, eat a crocodile?\\nI\\'ll do \\'t. Dost thou come here to whine?\\nTo outface me with leaping in her grave?\\nBe buried quick with her, and so will I.\\nAnd if thou prate of mountains, let them throw\\nMillions of acres on us, till our ground,\\nSingeing his pate against the burning zone,\\nMake Ossa like a wart. Nay, an thou \\'lt mouth,\\nI\\'ll rant as well as thou.\\n\\nQUEEN  This is mere madness;\\nAnd thus awhile the fit will work on him.\\nAnon, as patient as the female dove\\nWhen that her golden couplets are disclosed,\\nHis silence will sit drooping.\\n\\nHAMLET  Hear you, sir,\\nWhat is the reason that you use me thus?\\nI loved you ever. But it is no matter.\\nLet Hercules himself do what he may,\\nThe cat will mew, and dog will have his day.\\n[Hamlet exits.]\\n\\nKING\\nI pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.\\n[Horatio exits.]\\n[To Laertes.] Strengthen your patience in our last\\nnight\\'s speech.\\nWe\\'ll put the matter to the present push.--\\nGood Gertrude, set some watch over your son.--\\nThis grave shall have a living monument.\\nAn hour of quiet thereby shall we see.\\nTill then in patience our proceeding be.\\n[They exit.]\\n\\nScene 2\\n=======\\n[Enter Hamlet and Horatio.]\\n\\n\\nHAMLET\\nSo much for this, sir. Now shall you see the other.\\nYou do remember all the circumstance?\\n\\nHORATIO  Remember it, my lord!\\n\\nHAMLET\\nSir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting\\nThat would not let me sleep. Methought I lay\\nWorse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly--\\nAnd praised be rashness for it; let us know,\\nOur indiscretion sometime serves us well\\nWhen our deep plots do pall; and that should learn\\nus\\nThere\\'s a divinity that shapes our ends,\\nRough-hew them how we will--\\n\\nHORATIO  That is most\\ncertain.\\n\\nHAMLET  Up from my cabin,\\nMy sea-gown scarfed about me, in the dark\\nGroped I to find out them; had my desire,\\nFingered their packet, and in fine withdrew\\nTo mine own room again, making so bold\\n(My fears forgetting manners) to unfold\\nTheir grand commission; where I found, Horatio,\\nA royal knavery--an exact command,\\nLarded with many several sorts of reasons\\nImporting Denmark\\'s health and England\\'s too,\\nWith--ho!--such bugs and goblins in my life,\\nThat on the supervise, no leisure bated,\\nNo, not to stay the grinding of the ax,\\nMy head should be struck off.\\n\\nHORATIO  Is \\'t possible?\\n\\nHAMLET\\nHere\\'s the commission. Read it at more leisure.\\n[Handing him a paper.]\\nBut wilt thou hear now how I did proceed?\\n\\nHORATIO  I beseech you.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nBeing thus benetted round with villainies,\\nOr I could make a prologue to my brains,\\nThey had begun the play. I sat me down,\\nDevised a new commission, wrote it fair--\\nI once did hold it, as our statists do,\\nA baseness to write fair, and labored much\\nHow to forget that learning; but, sir, now\\nIt did me yeoman\\'s service. Wilt thou know\\nTh\\' effect of what I wrote?\\n\\nHORATIO  Ay, good my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nAn earnest conjuration from the King,\\nAs England was his faithful tributary,\\nAs love between them like the palm might flourish,\\nAs peace should still her wheaten garland wear\\nAnd stand a comma \\'tween their amities,\\nAnd many suchlike ases of great charge,\\nThat, on the view and knowing of these contents,\\nWithout debatement further, more or less,\\nHe should those bearers put to sudden death,\\nNot shriving time allowed.\\n\\nHORATIO  How was this sealed?\\n\\nHAMLET\\nWhy, even in that was heaven ordinant.\\nI had my father\\'s signet in my purse,\\nWhich was the model of that Danish seal;\\nFolded the writ up in the form of th\\' other,\\nSubscribed it, gave \\'t th\\' impression, placed it\\nsafely,\\nThe changeling never known. Now, the next day\\nWas our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent\\nThou knowest already.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nSo Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to \\'t.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nWhy, man, they did make love to this employment.\\nThey are not near my conscience. Their defeat\\nDoes by their own insinuation grow.\\n\\'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes\\nBetween the pass and fell incensed points\\nOf mighty opposites.\\n\\nHORATIO  Why, what a king is this!\\n\\nHAMLET\\nDoes it not, think thee, stand me now upon--\\nHe that hath killed my king and whored my mother,\\nPopped in between th\\' election and my hopes,\\nThrown out his angle for my proper life,\\nAnd with such cozenage--is \\'t not perfect\\nconscience\\nTo quit him with this arm? And is \\'t not to be\\ndamned\\nTo let this canker of our nature come\\nIn further evil?\\n\\nHORATIO\\nIt must be shortly known to him from England\\nWhat is the issue of the business there.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nIt will be short. The interim\\'s mine,\\nAnd a man\\'s life\\'s no more than to say \"one.\"\\nBut I am very sorry, good Horatio,\\nThat to Laertes I forgot myself,\\nFor by the image of my cause I see\\nThe portraiture of his. I\\'ll court his favors.\\nBut, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me\\nInto a tow\\'ring passion.\\n\\nHORATIO  Peace, who comes here?\\n\\n[Enter Osric, a courtier.]\\n\\n\\nOSRIC  Your Lordship is right welcome back to\\nDenmark.\\n\\nHAMLET  I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio.]\\nDost know this waterfly?\\n\\nHORATIO, [aside to Hamlet]  No, my good lord.\\n\\nHAMLET, [aside to Horatio]  Thy state is the more gracious,\\nfor \\'tis a vice to know him. He hath much\\nland, and fertile. Let a beast be lord of beasts and his\\ncrib shall stand at the king\\'s mess. \\'Tis a chough,\\nbut, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.\\n\\nOSRIC  Sweet lord, if your Lordship were at leisure, I\\nshould impart a thing to you from his Majesty.\\n\\nHAMLET  I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of\\nspirit. Put your bonnet to his right use: \\'tis for the\\nhead.\\n\\nOSRIC  I thank your Lordship; it is very hot.\\n\\nHAMLET  No, believe me, \\'tis very cold; the wind is\\nnortherly.\\n\\nOSRIC  It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.\\n\\nHAMLET  But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for\\nmy complexion.\\n\\nOSRIC  Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as\\n\\'twere--I cannot tell how. My lord, his Majesty\\nbade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager\\non your head. Sir, this is the matter--\\n\\nHAMLET  I beseech you, remember. [He motions to\\nOsric to put on his hat.]\\n\\nOSRIC  Nay, good my lord, for my ease, in good faith.\\nSir, here is newly come to court Laertes--believe\\nme, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent\\ndifferences, of very soft society and great showing.\\nIndeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or\\ncalendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the\\ncontinent of what part a gentleman would see.\\n\\nHAMLET  Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in\\nyou, though I know to divide him inventorially\\nwould dozy th\\' arithmetic of memory, and yet but\\nyaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the\\nverity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great\\narticle, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness\\nas, to make true diction of him, his semblable is his\\nmirror, and who else would trace him, his umbrage,\\nnothing more.\\n\\nOSRIC  Your Lordship speaks most infallibly of him.\\n\\nHAMLET  The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the\\ngentleman in our more rawer breath?\\n\\nOSRIC  Sir?\\n\\nHORATIO  Is \\'t not possible to understand in another\\ntongue? You will to \\'t, sir, really.\\n\\nHAMLET, [to Osric]  What imports the nomination of\\nthis gentleman?\\n\\nOSRIC  Of Laertes?\\n\\nHORATIO  His purse is empty already; all \\'s golden words\\nare spent.\\n\\nHAMLET  Of him, sir.\\n\\nOSRIC  I know you are not ignorant--\\n\\nHAMLET  I would you did, sir. Yet, in faith, if you did, it\\nwould not much approve me. Well, sir?\\n\\nOSRIC  You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes\\nis--\\n\\nHAMLET  I dare not confess that, lest I should compare\\nwith him in excellence. But to know a man well\\nwere to know himself.\\n\\nOSRIC  I mean, sir, for his weapon. But in the imputation\\nlaid on him by them, in his meed he\\'s\\nunfellowed.\\n\\nHAMLET  What\\'s his weapon?\\n\\nOSRIC  Rapier and dagger.\\n\\nHAMLET  That\\'s two of his weapons. But, well--\\n\\nOSRIC  The King, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary\\nhorses, against the which he has impawned, as I\\ntake it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their\\nassigns, as girdle, hangers, and so. Three of the\\ncarriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very\\nresponsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and\\nof very liberal conceit.\\n\\nHAMLET  What call you the \"carriages\"?\\n\\nHORATIO  I knew you must be edified by the margent\\nere you had done.\\n\\nOSRIC  The carriages, sir, are the hangers.\\n\\nHAMLET  The phrase would be more germane to the\\nmatter if we could carry a cannon by our sides. I\\nwould it might be \"hangers\" till then. But on. Six\\nBarbary horses against six French swords, their\\nassigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages--\\nthat\\'s the French bet against the Danish. Why is this\\nall \"impawned,\" as you call it?\\n\\nOSRIC  The King, sir, hath laid, sir, that in a dozen\\npasses between yourself and him, he shall not\\nexceed you three hits. He hath laid on twelve for\\nnine, and it would come to immediate trial if your\\nLordship would vouchsafe the answer.\\n\\nHAMLET  How if I answer no?\\n\\nOSRIC  I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person\\nin trial.\\n\\nHAMLET  Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his\\nMajesty, it is the breathing time of day with me. Let\\nthe foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the\\nKing hold his purpose, I will win for him, an I can.\\nIf not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd\\nhits.\\n\\nOSRIC  Shall I deliver you e\\'en so?\\n\\nHAMLET  To this effect, sir, after what flourish your\\nnature will.\\n\\nOSRIC  I commend my duty to your Lordship.\\n\\nHAMLET  Yours. [Osric exits.] He does well to commend\\nit himself. There are no tongues else for \\'s\\nturn.\\n\\nHORATIO  This lapwing runs away with the shell on his\\nhead.\\n\\nHAMLET  He did comply, sir, with his dug before he\\nsucked it. Thus has he (and many more of the same\\nbreed that I know the drossy age dotes on) only got\\nthe tune of the time, and, out of an habit of\\nencounter, a kind of yeasty collection, which carries\\nthem through and through the most fanned\\nand winnowed opinions; and do but blow them to\\ntheir trial, the bubbles are out.\\n\\n[Enter a Lord.]\\n\\n\\nLORD  My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by\\nyoung Osric, who brings back to him that you\\nattend him in the hall. He sends to know if your\\npleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will\\ntake longer time.\\n\\nHAMLET  I am constant to my purposes. They follow\\nthe King\\'s pleasure. If his fitness speaks, mine is\\nready now or whensoever, provided I be so able as\\nnow.\\n\\nLORD  The King and Queen and all are coming down.\\n\\nHAMLET  In happy time.\\n\\nLORD  The Queen desires you to use some gentle\\nentertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.\\n\\nHAMLET  She well instructs me.\\t[Lord exits.]\\n\\nHORATIO  You will lose, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  I do not think so. Since he went into France, I\\nhave been in continual practice. I shall win at the\\nodds; but thou wouldst not think how ill all\\'s here\\nabout my heart. But it is no matter.\\n\\nHORATIO  Nay, good my lord--\\n\\nHAMLET  It is but foolery, but it is such a kind of\\ngaingiving as would perhaps trouble a woman.\\n\\nHORATIO  If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will\\nforestall their repair hither and say you are not fit.\\n\\nHAMLET  Not a whit. We defy augury. There is a\\nspecial providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be\\nnow, \\'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be\\nnow; if it be not now, yet it will come. The\\nreadiness is all. Since no man of aught he leaves\\nknows, what is \\'t to leave betimes? Let be.\\n\\n[A table prepared. Enter Trumpets, Drums, and Officers\\nwith cushions, King, Queen, Osric, and all the state,\\nfoils, daggers, flagons of wine, and Laertes.]\\n\\n\\nKING\\nCome, Hamlet, come and take this hand from me.\\n[He puts Laertes\\' hand into Hamlet\\'s.]\\n\\nHAMLET, [to Laertes]\\nGive me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;\\nBut pardon \\'t as you are a gentleman. This presence\\nknows,\\nAnd you must needs have heard, how I am punished\\nWith a sore distraction. What I have done\\nThat might your nature, honor, and exception\\nRoughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.\\nWas \\'t Hamlet wronged Laertes? Never Hamlet.\\nIf Hamlet from himself be ta\\'en away,\\nAnd when he\\'s not himself does wrong Laertes,\\nThen Hamlet does it not; Hamlet denies it.\\nWho does it, then? His madness. If \\'t be so,\\nHamlet is of the faction that is wronged;\\nHis madness is poor Hamlet\\'s enemy.\\nSir, in this audience\\nLet my disclaiming from a purposed evil\\nFree me so far in your most generous thoughts\\nThat I have shot my arrow o\\'er the house\\nAnd hurt my brother.\\n\\nLAERTES  I am satisfied in nature,\\nWhose motive in this case should stir me most\\nTo my revenge; but in my terms of honor\\nI stand aloof and will no reconcilement\\nTill by some elder masters of known honor\\nI have a voice and precedent of peace\\nTo keep my name ungored. But till that time\\nI do receive your offered love like love\\nAnd will not wrong it.\\n\\nHAMLET  I embrace it freely\\nAnd will this brothers\\' wager frankly play.--\\nGive us the foils. Come on.\\n\\nLAERTES  Come, one for me.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nI\\'ll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance\\nYour skill shall, like a star i\\' th\\' darkest night,\\nStick fiery off indeed.\\n\\nLAERTES  You mock me, sir.\\n\\nHAMLET  No, by this hand.\\n\\nKING\\nGive them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,\\nYou know the wager?\\n\\nHAMLET  Very well, my lord.\\nYour Grace has laid the odds o\\' th\\' weaker side.\\n\\nKING\\nI do not fear it; I have seen you both.\\nBut, since he is better, we have therefore odds.\\n\\nLAERTES\\nThis is too heavy. Let me see another.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nThis likes me well. These foils have all a length?\\n\\nOSRIC  Ay, my good lord.\\n[Prepare to play.]\\n\\nKING\\nSet me the stoups of wine upon that table.--\\nIf Hamlet give the first or second hit\\nOr quit in answer of the third exchange,\\nLet all the battlements their ordnance fire.\\nThe King shall drink to Hamlet\\'s better breath,\\nAnd in the cup an union shall he throw,\\nRicher than that which four successive kings\\nIn Denmark\\'s crown have worn. Give me the cups,\\nAnd let the kettle to the trumpet speak,\\nThe trumpet to the cannoneer without,\\nThe cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,\\n\"Now the King drinks to Hamlet.\" Come, begin.\\nAnd you, the judges, bear a wary eye.\\n[Trumpets the while.]\\n\\nHAMLET  Come on, sir.\\n\\nLAERTES  Come, my lord.\\t[They play.]\\n\\nHAMLET  One.\\n\\nLAERTES  No.\\n\\nHAMLET  Judgment!\\n\\nOSRIC  A hit, a very palpable hit.\\n\\nLAERTES  Well, again.\\n\\nKING\\nStay, give me drink.--Hamlet, this pearl is thine.\\nHere\\'s to thy health.\\n[He drinks and then drops the pearl in the cup.]\\n[Drum, trumpets, and shot.]\\nGive him the cup.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nI\\'ll play this bout first. Set it by awhile.\\nCome. [They play.] Another hit. What say you?\\n\\nLAERTES\\nA touch, a touch. I do confess \\'t.\\n\\nKING\\nOur son shall win.\\n\\nQUEEN  He\\'s fat and scant of breath.--\\nHere, Hamlet, take my napkin; rub thy brows.\\nThe Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.\\n[She lifts the cup.]\\n\\nHAMLET  Good madam.\\n\\nKING  Gertrude, do not drink.\\n\\nQUEEN\\nI will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.\\t[She drinks.]\\n\\nKING, [aside]\\nIt is the poisoned cup. It is too late.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nI dare not drink yet, madam--by and by.\\n\\nQUEEN  Come, let me wipe thy face.\\n\\nLAERTES, [to Claudius]\\nMy lord, I\\'ll hit him now.\\n\\nKING  I do not think \\'t.\\n\\nLAERTES, [aside]\\nAnd yet it is almost against my conscience.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nCome, for the third, Laertes. You do but dally.\\nI pray you pass with your best violence.\\nI am afeard you make a wanton of me.\\n\\nLAERTES  Say you so? Come on.\\t[Play.]\\n\\nOSRIC  Nothing neither way.\\n\\nLAERTES  Have at you now!\\n[Laertes wounds Hamlet. Then in scuffling they change\\nrapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes.]\\n\\nKING  Part them. They are incensed.\\n\\nHAMLET  Nay, come again.\\n[The Queen falls.]\\n\\nOSRIC  Look to the Queen there, ho!\\n\\nHORATIO\\nThey bleed on both sides.--How is it, my lord?\\n\\nOSRIC  How is \\'t, Laertes?\\n\\nLAERTES\\nWhy as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.\\n[He falls.]\\nI am justly killed with mine own treachery.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nHow does the Queen?\\n\\nKING  She swoons to see them bleed.\\n\\nQUEEN\\nNo, no, the drink, the drink! O, my dear Hamlet!\\nThe drink, the drink! I am poisoned.\\t[She dies.]\\n\\nHAMLET\\nO villainy! Ho! Let the door be locked.\\t[Osric exits.]\\nTreachery!

Hamlet, thou art slain.\\nNo med\\'cine in the world can do thee good.\\nIn thee there is not half an hour\\'s life.\\nThe treacherous instrument is in thy hand,\\nUnbated and envenomed. The foul practice\\nHath turned itself on me. Lo, here I lie,\\nNever to rise again. Thy mother\\'s poisoned.\\nI can no more. The King, the King\\'s to blame.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nThe point envenomed too!

Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the\\nQueen, the Council, as Polonius, and his son Laertes,\\nHamlet, with others, among them Voltemand and\\nCornelius.]\\n\\n\\nKING\\nThough yet of Hamlet our dear brother\\'s death\\nThe memory be green, and that it us befitted\\nTo bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom\\nTo be contracted in one brow of woe,\\nYet so far hath discretion fought with nature\\nThat we with wisest sorrow think on him\\nTogether with remembrance of ourselves.\\nTherefore our sometime sister, now our queen,\\nTh\\' imperial jointress to this warlike state,\\nHave we (as \\'twere with a defeated joy,\\nWith an auspicious and a dropping eye,\\nWith mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,\\nIn equal scale weighing delight and dole)\\nTaken to wife. Nor have we herein barred\\nYour better wisdoms, which have freely gone\\nWith this affair along. For all, our thanks.\\nNow follows that you know. Young Fortinbras,\\nHolding a weak supposal of our worth\\nOr thinking by our late dear brother\\'s death\\nOur state to be disjoint and out of frame,\\nColleagued with this dream of his advantage,\\nHe hath not failed to pester us with message\\nImporting the surrender of those lands\\nLost by his father, with all bonds of law,\\nTo our most valiant brother--so much for him.\\nNow for ourself and for this time of meeting.\\nThus much the business is: we have here writ\\nTo Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,\\nWho, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears\\nOf this his nephew\\'s purpose, to suppress\\nHis further gait herein, in that the levies,\\nThe lists, and full proportions are all made\\nOut of his subject; and we here dispatch\\nYou, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,\\nFor bearers of this greeting to old Norway,\\nGiving to you no further personal power\\nTo business with the King more than the scope\\nOf these dilated articles allow.\\n[Giving them a paper.]\\nFarewell, and let your haste commend your duty.\\n\\nCORNELIUS/VOLTEMAND\\nIn that and all things will we show our duty.\\n\\nKING\\nWe doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.\\n[Voltemand and Cornelius exit.]\\nAnd now, Laertes, what\\'s the news with you?\\nYou told us of some suit. What is \\'t, Laertes?\\nYou cannot speak of reason to the Dane\\nAnd lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg,\\nLaertes,\\nThat shall not be my offer, not thy asking?\\nThe head is not more native to the heart,\\nThe hand more instrumental to the mouth,\\nThan is the throne of Denmark to thy father.\\nWhat wouldst thou have, Laertes?\\n\\nLAERTES  My dread lord,\\nYour leave and favor to return to France,\\nFrom whence though willingly I came to Denmark\\nTo show my duty in your coronation,\\nYet now I must confess, that duty done,\\nMy thoughts and wishes bend again toward France\\nAnd bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.\\n\\nKING\\nHave you your father\\'s leave? What says Polonius?\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nHath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave\\nBy laborsome petition, and at last\\nUpon his will I sealed my hard consent.\\nI do beseech you give him leave to go.\\n\\nKING\\nTake thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,\\nAnd thy best graces spend it at thy will.--\\nBut now, my cousin Hamlet and my son--\\n\\nHAMLET, [aside]\\nA little more than kin and less than kind.\\n\\nKING\\nHow is it that the clouds still hang on you?\\n\\nHAMLET\\nNot so, my lord; I am too much in the sun.\\n\\nQUEEN\\nGood Hamlet, cast thy nighted color off,\\nAnd let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.\\nDo not forever with thy vailed lids\\nSeek for thy noble father in the dust.\\nThou know\\'st \\'tis common; all that lives must die,\\nPassing through nature to eternity.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nAy, madam, it is common.\\n\\nQUEEN  If it be,\\nWhy seems it so particular with thee?\\n\\nHAMLET\\n\"Seems,\" madam? Nay, it is. I know not \"seems.\"\\n\\'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,\\nNor customary suits of solemn black,\\nNor windy suspiration of forced breath,\\nNo, nor the fruitful river in the eye,\\nNor the dejected havior of the visage,\\nTogether with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,\\nThat can denote me truly. These indeed \"seem,\"\\nFor they are actions that a man might play;\\nBut I have that within which passes show,\\nThese but the trappings and the suits of woe.\\n\\nKING\\n\\'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature,\\nHamlet,\\nTo give these mourning duties to your father.\\nBut you must know your father lost a father,\\nThat father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound\\nIn filial obligation for some term\\nTo do obsequious sorrow. But to persever\\nIn obstinate condolement is a course\\nOf impious stubbornness. \\'Tis unmanly grief.\\nIt shows a will most incorrect to heaven,\\nA heart unfortified, a mind impatient,\\nAn understanding simple and unschooled.\\nFor what we know must be and is as common\\nAs any the most vulgar thing to sense,\\nWhy should we in our peevish opposition\\nTake it to heart? Fie, \\'tis a fault to heaven,\\nA fault against the dead, a fault to nature,\\nTo reason most absurd, whose common theme\\nIs death of fathers, and who still hath cried,\\nFrom the first corse till he that died today,\\n\"This must be so.\" We pray you, throw to earth\\nThis unprevailing woe and think of us\\nAs of a father; for let the world take note,\\nYou are the most immediate to our throne,\\nAnd with no less nobility of love\\nThan that which dearest father bears his son\\nDo I impart toward you. For your intent\\nIn going back to school in Wittenberg,\\nIt is most retrograde to our desire,\\nAnd we beseech you, bend you to remain\\nHere in the cheer and comfort of our eye,\\nOur chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.\\n\\nQUEEN\\nLet not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.\\nI pray thee, stay with us. Go not to Wittenberg.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nI shall in all my best obey you, madam.\\n\\nKING\\nWhy, \\'tis a loving and a fair reply.\\nBe as ourself in Denmark.--Madam, come.\\nThis gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet\\nSits smiling to my heart, in grace whereof\\nNo jocund health that Denmark drinks today\\nBut the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,\\nAnd the King\\'s rouse the heaven shall bruit again,\\nRespeaking earthly thunder.

Things rank and gross in nature\\nPossess it merely. That it should come to this:\\nBut two months dead--nay, not so much, not two.\\nSo excellent a king, that was to this\\nHyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother\\nThat he might not beteem the winds of heaven\\nVisit her face too roughly. Heaven and Earth,\\nMust I remember? Why, she would hang on him\\nAs if increase of appetite had grown\\nBy what it fed on. And yet, within a month\\n(Let me not think on \\'t; frailty, thy name is woman!),\\nA little month, or ere those shoes were old\\nWith which she followed my poor father\\'s body,\\nLike Niobe, all tears--why she, even she\\n(O God, a beast that wants discourse of reason\\nWould have mourned longer!), married with my\\nuncle,\\nMy father\\'s brother, but no more like my father\\nThan I to Hercules. Within a month,\\nEre yet the salt of most unrighteous tears\\nHad left the flushing in her galled eyes,\\nShe married.

Thrice he walked\\nBy their oppressed and fear-surprised eyes\\nWithin his truncheon\\'s length, whilst they, distilled\\nAlmost to jelly with the act of fear,\\nStand dumb and speak not to him. This to me\\nIn dreadful secrecy impart they did,\\nAnd I with them the third night kept the watch,\\nWhere, as they had delivered, both in time,\\nForm of the thing (each word made true and good),\\nThe apparition comes. I knew your father;\\nThese hands are not more like.\\n\\nHAMLET  But where was this?\\n\\nMARCELLUS\\nMy lord, upon the platform where we watch.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nDid you not speak to it?\\n\\nHORATIO  My lord, I did,\\nBut answer made it none. Yet once methought\\nIt lifted up its head and did address\\nItself to motion, like as it would speak;\\nBut even then the morning cock crew loud,\\nAnd at the sound it shrunk in haste away\\nAnd vanished from our sight.\\n\\nHAMLET  \\'Tis very strange.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nAs I do live, my honored lord, \\'tis true.\\nAnd we did think it writ down in our duty\\nTo let you know of it.\\n\\nHAMLET  Indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.\\nHold you the watch tonight?\\n\\nALL  We do, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nArmed, say you?\\n\\nALL  Armed, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  From top to toe?\\n\\nALL  My lord, from head to foot.\\n\\nHAMLET  Then saw you not his face?\\n\\nHORATIO\\nO, yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up.\\n\\nHAMLET  What, looked he frowningly?\\n\\nHORATIO\\nA countenance more in sorrow than in anger.\\n\\nHAMLET  Pale or red?\\n\\nHORATIO\\nNay, very pale.\\n\\nHAMLET  And fixed his eyes upon you?\\n\\nHORATIO\\nMost constantly.\\n\\nHAMLET  I would I had been there.\\n\\nHORATIO  It would have much amazed you.\\n\\nHAMLET  Very like.

Farewell.\\nAnd, sister, as the winds give benefit\\nAnd convey is assistant, do not sleep,\\nBut let me hear from you.\\n\\nOPHELIA  Do you doubt that?\\n\\nLAERTES\\nFor Hamlet, and the trifling of his favor,\\nHold it a fashion and a toy in blood,\\nA violet in the youth of primy nature,\\nForward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,\\nThe perfume and suppliance of a minute,\\nNo more.\\n\\nOPHELIA  No more but so?\\n\\nLAERTES  Think it no more.\\nFor nature, crescent, does not grow alone\\nIn thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,\\nThe inward service of the mind and soul\\nGrows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,\\nAnd now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch\\nThe virtue of his will; but you must fear,\\nHis greatness weighed, his will is not his own,\\nFor he himself is subject to his birth.\\nHe may not, as unvalued persons do,\\nCarve for himself, for on his choice depends\\nThe safety and the health of this whole state.\\nAnd therefore must his choice be circumscribed\\nUnto the voice and yielding of that body\\nWhereof he is the head. Then, if he says he loves\\nyou,\\nIt fits your wisdom so far to believe it\\nAs he in his particular act and place\\nMay give his saying deed, which is no further\\nThan the main voice of Denmark goes withal.\\nThen weigh what loss your honor may sustain\\nIf with too credent ear you list his songs\\nOr lose your heart or your chaste treasure open\\nTo his unmastered importunity.\\nFear it, Ophelia; fear it, my dear sister,\\nAnd keep you in the rear of your affection,\\nOut of the shot and danger of desire.\\nThe chariest maid is prodigal enough\\nIf she unmask her beauty to the moon.\\nVirtue itself \\'scapes not calumnious strokes.\\nThe canker galls the infants of the spring\\nToo oft before their buttons be disclosed,\\nAnd, in the morn and liquid dew of youth,\\nContagious blastments are most imminent.\\nBe wary, then; best safety lies in fear.\\nYouth to itself rebels, though none else near.\\n\\nOPHELIA\\nI shall the effect of this good lesson keep\\nAs watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,\\nDo not, as some ungracious pastors do,\\nShow me the steep and thorny way to heaven,\\nWhiles, like a puffed and reckless libertine,\\nHimself the primrose path of dalliance treads\\nAnd recks not his own rede.\\n\\nLAERTES  O, fear me not.\\n\\n[Enter Polonius.]\\n\\nI stay too long. But here my father comes.\\nA double blessing is a double grace.\\nOccasion smiles upon a second leave.\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nYet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!\\nThe wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,\\nAnd you are stayed for. There, my blessing with\\nthee.\\nAnd these few precepts in thy memory\\nLook thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,\\nNor any unproportioned thought his act.\\nBe thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.\\nThose friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,\\nGrapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel,\\nBut do not dull thy palm with entertainment\\nOf each new-hatched, unfledged courage. Beware\\nOf entrance to a quarrel, but, being in,\\nBear \\'t that th\\' opposed may beware of thee.\\nGive every man thy ear, but few thy voice.\\nTake each man\\'s censure, but reserve thy judgment.\\nCostly thy habit as thy purse can buy,\\nBut not expressed in fancy (rich, not gaudy),\\nFor the apparel oft proclaims the man,\\nAnd they in France of the best rank and station\\nAre of a most select and generous chief in that.\\nNeither a borrower nor a lender be,\\nFor loan oft loses both itself and friend,\\nAnd borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.\\nThis above all: to thine own self be true,\\nAnd it must follow, as the night the day,\\nThou canst not then be false to any man.\\nFarewell.

Go, your servants tend.\\n\\nLAERTES\\nFarewell, Ophelia, and remember well\\nWhat I have said to you.\\n\\nOPHELIA  \\'Tis in my memory locked,\\nAnd you yourself shall keep the key of it.\\n\\nLAERTES  Farewell.\\t[Laertes exits.]\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nWhat is \\'t, Ophelia, he hath said to you?\\n\\nOPHELIA\\nSo please you, something touching the Lord\\nHamlet.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  Marry, well bethought.\\n\\'Tis told me he hath very oft of late\\nGiven private time to you, and you yourself\\nHave of your audience been most free and\\nbounteous.\\nIf it be so (as so \\'tis put on me,\\nAnd that in way of caution), I must tell you\\nYou do not understand yourself so clearly\\nAs it behooves my daughter and your honor.\\nWhat is between you? Give me up the truth.\\n\\nOPHELIA\\nHe hath, my lord, of late made many tenders\\nOf his affection to me.\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nAffection, puh! You speak like a green girl\\nUnsifted in such perilous circumstance.\\nDo you believe his \"tenders,\" as you call them?\\n\\nOPHELIA\\nI do not know, my lord, what I should think.\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nMarry, I will teach you. Think yourself a baby\\nThat you have ta\\'en these tenders for true pay,\\nWhich are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,\\nOr (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,\\nRunning it thus) you\\'ll tender me a fool.\\n\\nOPHELIA\\nMy lord, he hath importuned me with love\\nIn honorable fashion--\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nAy, \"fashion\" you may call it. Go to, go to!\\n\\nOPHELIA\\nAnd hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,\\nWith almost all the holy vows of heaven.\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nAy, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,\\nWhen the blood burns, how prodigal the soul\\nLends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,\\nGiving more light than heat, extinct in both\\nEven in their promise as it is a-making,\\nYou must not take for fire. From this time\\nBe something scanter of your maiden presence.\\nSet your entreatments at a higher rate\\nThan a command to parle. For Lord Hamlet,\\nBelieve so much in him that he is young,\\nAnd with a larger tether may he walk\\nThan may be given you. In few, Ophelia,\\nDo not believe his vows, for they are brokers,\\nNot of that dye which their investments show,\\nBut mere implorators of unholy suits,\\nBreathing like sanctified and pious bawds\\nThe better to beguile. This is for all:\\nI would not, in plain terms, from this time forth\\nHave you so slander any moment leisure\\nAs to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.\\nLook to \\'t, I charge you. Come your ways.\\n\\nOPHELIA  I shall obey, my lord.\\n[They exit.]\\n\\nScene 4\\n=======\\n[Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.]\\n\\n\\nHAMLET\\nThe air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nIt is a nipping and an eager air.\\n\\nHAMLET  What hour now?\\n\\nHORATIO  I think it lacks of twelve.\\n\\nMARCELLUS  No, it is struck.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nIndeed, I heard it not. It then draws near the season\\nWherein the spirit held his wont to walk.\\n[A flourish of trumpets and two pieces goes off.]\\nWhat does this mean, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET\\nThe King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse,\\nKeeps wassail, and the swagg\\'ring upspring reels;\\nAnd, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,\\nThe kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out\\nThe triumph of his pledge.\\n\\nHORATIO  Is it a custom?\\n\\nHAMLET  Ay, marry, is \\'t,\\nBut, to my mind, though I am native here\\nAnd to the manner born, it is a custom\\nMore honored in the breach than the observance.\\nThis heavy-headed revel east and west\\nMakes us traduced and taxed of other nations.\\nThey clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase\\nSoil our addition. And, indeed, it takes\\nFrom our achievements, though performed at\\nheight,\\nThe pith and marrow of our attribute.\\nSo oft it chances in particular men\\nThat for some vicious mole of nature in them,\\nAs in their birth (wherein they are not guilty,\\nSince nature cannot choose his origin),\\nBy the o\\'ergrowth of some complexion\\n(Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason),\\nOr by some habit that too much o\\'erleavens\\nThe form of plausive manners--that these men,\\nCarrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,\\nBeing nature\\'s livery or fortune\\'s star,\\nHis virtues else, be they as pure as grace,\\nAs infinite as man may undergo,\\nShall in the general censure take corruption\\nFrom that particular fault. The dram of evil\\nDoth all the noble substance of a doubt\\nTo his own scandal.\\n\\n[Enter Ghost.]\\n\\n\\nHORATIO  Look, my lord, it comes.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nAngels and ministers of grace, defend us!\\nBe thou a spirit of health or goblin damned,\\nBring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from\\nhell,\\nBe thy intents wicked or charitable,\\nThou com\\'st in such a questionable shape\\nThat I will speak to thee. I\\'ll call thee \"Hamlet,\"\\n\"King,\" \"Father,\" \"Royal Dane.\" O, answer me!\\nLet me not burst in ignorance, but tell\\nWhy thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,\\nHave burst their cerements; why the sepulcher,\\nWherein we saw thee quietly interred,\\nHath oped his ponderous and marble jaws\\nTo cast thee up again. What may this mean\\nThat thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,\\nRevisits thus the glimpses of the moon,\\nMaking night hideous, and we fools of nature\\nSo horridly to shake our disposition\\nWith thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?\\nSay, why is this? Wherefore? What should we do?\\n[Ghost beckons.]\\n\\nHORATIO\\nIt beckons you to go away with it\\nAs if it some impartment did desire\\nTo you alone.\\n\\nMARCELLUS  Look with what courteous action\\nIt waves you to a more removed ground.\\nBut do not go with it.\\n\\nHORATIO  No, by no means.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nIt will not speak. Then I will follow it.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nDo not, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  Why, what should be the fear?\\nI do not set my life at a pin\\'s fee.\\nAnd for my soul, what can it do to that,\\nBeing a thing immortal as itself?\\nIt waves me forth again. I\\'ll follow it.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nWhat if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord?\\nOr to the dreadful summit of the cliff\\nThat beetles o\\'er his base into the sea,\\nAnd there assume some other horrible form\\nWhich might deprive your sovereignty of reason\\nAnd draw you into madness? Think of it.\\nThe very place puts toys of desperation,\\nWithout more motive, into every brain\\nThat looks so many fathoms to the sea\\nAnd hears it roar beneath.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nIt waves me still.--Go on, I\\'ll follow thee.\\n\\nMARCELLUS\\nYou shall not go, my lord.\\t[They hold back Hamlet.]\\n\\nHAMLET  Hold off your hands.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nBe ruled. You shall not go.\\n\\nHAMLET  My fate cries out\\nAnd makes each petty arture in this body\\nAs hardy as the Nemean lion\\'s nerve.\\nStill am I called. Unhand me, gentlemen.\\nBy heaven, I\\'ll make a ghost of him that lets me!\\nI say, away!--Go on. I\\'ll follow thee.\\n[Ghost and Hamlet exit.]\\n\\nHORATIO\\nHe waxes desperate with imagination.\\n\\nMARCELLUS\\nLet\\'s follow. \\'Tis not fit thus to obey him.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nHave after. To what issue will this come?\\n\\nMARCELLUS\\nSomething is rotten in the state of Denmark.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nHeaven will direct it.\\n\\nMARCELLUS  Nay, let\\'s follow him.\\n[They exit.]\\n\\nScene 5\\n=======\\n[Enter Ghost and Hamlet.]\\n\\n\\nHAMLET\\nWhither wilt thou lead me?

But that I am forbid\\nTo tell the secrets of my prison house,\\nI could a tale unfold whose lightest word\\nWould harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,\\nMake thy two eyes, like stars, start from their\\nspheres,\\nThy knotted and combined locks to part,\\nAnd each particular hair to stand an end,\\nLike quills upon the fearful porpentine.\\nBut this eternal blazon must not be\\nTo ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O list!\\nIf thou didst ever thy dear father love--\\n\\nHAMLET  O God!\\n\\nGHOST\\nRevenge his foul and most unnatural murder.\\n\\nHAMLET  Murder?\\n\\nGHOST\\nMurder most foul, as in the best it is,\\nBut this most foul, strange, and unnatural.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nHaste me to know \\'t, that I, with wings as swift\\nAs meditation or the thoughts of love,\\nMay sweep to my revenge.\\n\\nGHOST  I find thee apt;\\nAnd duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed\\nThat roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,\\nWouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.\\n\\'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,\\nA serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark\\nIs by a forged process of my death\\nRankly abused. But know, thou noble youth,\\nThe serpent that did sting thy father\\'s life\\nNow wears his crown.\\n\\nHAMLET  O, my prophetic soul! My uncle!\\n\\nGHOST\\nAy, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,\\nWith witchcraft of his wits, with traitorous gifts--\\nO wicked wit and gifts, that have the power\\nSo to seduce!--won to his shameful lust\\nThe will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.\\nO Hamlet, what a falling off was there!\\nFrom me, whose love was of that dignity\\nThat it went hand in hand even with the vow\\nI made to her in marriage, and to decline\\nUpon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor\\nTo those of mine.\\nBut virtue, as it never will be moved,\\nThough lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,\\nSo, lust, though to a radiant angel linked,\\nWill sate itself in a celestial bed\\nAnd prey on garbage.\\nBut soft, methinks I scent the morning air.\\nBrief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,\\nMy custom always of the afternoon,\\nUpon my secure hour thy uncle stole\\nWith juice of cursed hebona in a vial\\nAnd in the porches of my ears did pour\\nThe leprous distilment, whose effect\\nHolds such an enmity with blood of man\\nThat swift as quicksilver it courses through\\nThe natural gates and alleys of the body,\\nAnd with a sudden vigor it doth posset\\nAnd curd, like eager droppings into milk,\\nThe thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine,\\nAnd a most instant tetter barked about,\\nMost lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust\\nAll my smooth body.\\nThus was I, sleeping, by a brother\\'s hand\\nOf life, of crown, of queen at once dispatched,\\nCut off, even in the blossoms of my sin,\\nUnhouseled, disappointed, unaneled,\\nNo reck\\'ning made, but sent to my account\\nWith all my imperfections on my head.\\nO horrible, O horrible, most horrible!\\nIf thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.\\nLet not the royal bed of Denmark be\\nA couch for luxury and damned incest.\\nBut, howsomever thou pursues this act,\\nTaint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive\\nAgainst thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven\\nAnd to those thorns that in her bosom lodge\\nTo prick and sting her.

Remember thee?\\nYea, from the table of my memory\\nI\\'ll wipe away all trivial, fond records,\\nAll saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,\\nThat youth and observation copied there,\\nAnd thy commandment all alone shall live\\nWithin the book and volume of my brain,\\nUnmixed with baser matter.

Look you, sir,\\nInquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;\\nAnd how, and who, what means, and where they\\nkeep,\\nWhat company, at what expense; and finding\\nBy this encompassment and drift of question\\nThat they do know my son, come you more nearer\\nThan your particular demands will touch it.\\nTake you, as \\'twere, some distant knowledge of him,\\nAs thus: \"I know his father and his friends\\nAnd, in part, him.\" Do you mark this, Reynaldo?\\n\\nREYNALDO  Ay, very well, my lord.\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\n\"And, in part, him, but,\" you may say, \"not well.\\nBut if \\'t be he I mean, he\\'s very wild,\\nAddicted so and so.\" And there put on him\\nWhat forgeries you please--marry, none so rank\\nAs may dishonor him, take heed of that,\\nBut, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips\\nAs are companions noted and most known\\nTo youth and liberty.\\n\\nREYNALDO  As gaming, my lord.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing,\\nQuarreling, drabbing--you may go so far.\\n\\nREYNALDO  My lord, that would dishonor him.\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nFaith, no, as you may season it in the charge.\\nYou must not put another scandal on him\\nThat he is open to incontinency;\\nThat\\'s not my meaning. But breathe his faults so\\nquaintly\\nThat they may seem the taints of liberty,\\nThe flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,\\nA savageness in unreclaimed blood,\\nOf general assault.\\n\\nREYNALDO  But, my good lord--\\n\\nPOLONIUS  Wherefore should you do this?\\n\\nREYNALDO  Ay, my lord, I would know that.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  Marry, sir, here\\'s my drift,\\nAnd I believe it is a fetch of wit.\\nYou, laying these slight sullies on my son,\\nAs \\'twere a thing a little soiled i\\' th\\' working,\\nMark you, your party in converse, him you would\\nsound,\\nHaving ever seen in the prenominate crimes\\nThe youth you breathe of guilty, be assured\\nHe closes with you in this consequence:\\n\"Good sir,\" or so, or \"friend,\" or \"gentleman,\"\\nAccording to the phrase or the addition\\nOf man and country--\\n\\nREYNALDO  Very good, my lord.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  And then, sir, does he this, he does--what\\nwas I about to say?

Long stayed he so.\\nAt last, a little shaking of mine arm,\\nAnd thrice his head thus waving up and down,\\nHe raised a sigh so piteous and profound\\nAs it did seem to shatter all his bulk\\nAnd end his being. That done, he lets me go,\\nAnd, with his head over his shoulder turned,\\nHe seemed to find his way without his eyes,\\nFor out o\\' doors he went without their helps\\nAnd to the last bended their light on me.\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nCome, go with me. I will go seek the King.\\nThis is the very ecstasy of love,\\nWhose violent property fordoes itself\\nAnd leads the will to desperate undertakings\\nAs oft as any passions under heaven\\nThat does afflict our natures. I am sorry.\\nWhat, have you given him any hard words of late?\\n\\nOPHELIA\\nNo, my good lord, but as you did command\\nI did repel his letters and denied\\nHis access to me.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  That hath made him mad.\\nI am sorry that with better heed and judgment\\nI had not coted him. I feared he did but trifle\\nAnd meant to wrack thee. But beshrew my jealousy!\\nBy heaven, it is as proper to our age\\nTo cast beyond ourselves in our opinions\\nAs it is common for the younger sort\\nTo lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.\\nThis must be known, which, being kept close, might\\nmove\\nMore grief to hide than hate to utter love.\\nCome.\\n[They exit.]\\n\\nScene 2\\n=======\\n[Flourish. Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and\\nGuildenstern and Attendants.]\\n\\n\\nKING\\nWelcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.\\nMoreover that we much did long to see you,\\nThe need we have to use you did provoke\\nOur hasty sending. Something have you heard\\nOf Hamlet\\'s transformation, so call it,\\nSith nor th\\' exterior nor the inward man\\nResembles that it was. What it should be,\\nMore than his father\\'s death, that thus hath put him\\nSo much from th\\' understanding of himself\\nI cannot dream of. I entreat you both\\nThat, being of so young days brought up with him\\nAnd sith so neighbored to his youth and havior,\\nThat you vouchsafe your rest here in our court\\nSome little time, so by your companies\\nTo draw him on to pleasures, and to gather\\nSo much as from occasion you may glean,\\nWhether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus\\nThat, opened, lies within our remedy.\\n\\nQUEEN\\nGood gentlemen, he hath much talked of you,\\nAnd sure I am two men there is not living\\nTo whom he more adheres. If it will please you\\nTo show us so much gentry and goodwill\\nAs to expend your time with us awhile\\nFor the supply and profit of our hope,\\nYour visitation shall receive such thanks\\nAs fits a king\\'s remembrance.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Both your Majesties\\nMight, by the sovereign power you have of us,\\nPut your dread pleasures more into command\\nThan to entreaty.\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN  But we both obey,\\nAnd here give up ourselves in the full bent\\nTo lay our service freely at your feet,\\nTo be commanded.\\n\\nKING\\nThanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.\\n\\nQUEEN\\nThanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.\\nAnd I beseech you instantly to visit\\nMy too much changed son.--Go, some of you,\\nAnd bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN\\nHeavens make our presence and our practices\\nPleasant and helpful to him!\\n\\nQUEEN  Ay, amen!\\n[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern exit\\nwith some Attendants.]\\n\\n[Enter Polonius.]\\n\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nTh\\' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,\\nAre joyfully returned.\\n\\nKING\\nThou still hast been the father of good news.\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nHave I, my lord? I assure my good liege\\nI hold my duty as I hold my soul,\\nBoth to my God and to my gracious king,\\nAnd I do think, or else this brain of mine\\nHunts not the trail of policy so sure\\nAs it hath used to do, that I have found\\nThe very cause of Hamlet\\'s lunacy.\\n\\nKING\\nO, speak of that! That do I long to hear.\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nGive first admittance to th\\' ambassadors.\\nMy news shall be the fruit to that great feast.\\n\\nKING\\nThyself do grace to them and bring them in.\\n[Polonius exits.]\\nHe tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found\\nThe head and source of all your son\\'s distemper.\\n\\nQUEEN\\nI doubt it is no other but the main--\\nHis father\\'s death and our o\\'erhasty marriage.\\n\\nKING\\nWell, we shall sift him.\\n\\n[Enter Ambassadors Voltemand and Cornelius with\\nPolonius.]\\n\\nWelcome, my good friends.\\nSay, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?\\n\\nVOLTEMAND\\nMost fair return of greetings and desires.\\nUpon our first, he sent out to suppress\\nHis nephew\\'s levies, which to him appeared\\nTo be a preparation \\'gainst the Polack,\\nBut, better looked into, he truly found\\nIt was against your Highness. Whereat, grieved\\nThat so his sickness, age, and impotence\\nWas falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests\\nOn Fortinbras, which he, in brief, obeys,\\nReceives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,\\nMakes vow before his uncle never more\\nTo give th\\' assay of arms against your Majesty.\\nWhereon old Norway, overcome with joy,\\nGives him three-score thousand crowns in annual\\nfee\\nAnd his commission to employ those soldiers,\\nSo levied as before, against the Polack,\\nWith an entreaty, herein further shown,\\n[He gives a paper.]\\nThat it might please you to give quiet pass\\nThrough your dominions for this enterprise,\\nOn such regards of safety and allowance\\nAs therein are set down.\\n\\nKING  It likes us well,\\nAnd, at our more considered time, we\\'ll read,\\nAnswer, and think upon this business.\\nMeantime, we thank you for your well-took labor.\\nGo to your rest. At night we\\'ll feast together.\\nMost welcome home!\\n[Voltemand and Cornelius exit.]\\n\\nPOLONIUS  This business is well ended.\\nMy liege, and madam, to expostulate\\nWhat majesty should be, what duty is,\\nWhy day is day, night night, and time is time\\nWere nothing but to waste night, day, and time.\\nTherefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,\\nAnd tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,\\nI will be brief. Your noble son is mad.\\n\"Mad\" call I it, for, to define true madness,\\nWhat is \\'t but to be nothing else but mad?\\nBut let that go.\\n\\nQUEEN  More matter with less art.\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nMadam, I swear I use no art at all.\\nThat he\\'s mad, \\'tis true; \\'tis true \\'tis pity,\\nAnd pity \\'tis \\'tis true--a foolish figure,\\nBut farewell it, for I will use no art.\\nMad let us grant him then, and now remains\\nThat we find out the cause of this effect,\\nOr, rather say, the cause of this defect,\\nFor this effect defective comes by cause.\\nThus it remains, and the remainder thus.\\nPerpend.\\nI have a daughter (have while she is mine)\\nWho, in her duty and obedience, mark,\\nHath given me this. Now gather and surmise.\\n[He reads.] To the celestial, and my soul\\'s idol, the\\nmost beautified Ophelia--\\nThat\\'s an ill phrase, a vile phrase; \"beautified\" is a\\nvile phrase. But you shall hear. Thus: [He reads.]\\nIn her excellent white bosom, these, etc.--\\n\\nQUEEN  Came this from Hamlet to her?\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nGood madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.\\n[He reads the letter.]\\n\\tDoubt thou the stars are fire,\\n\\t   Doubt that the sun doth move,\\n\\tDoubt truth to be a liar,\\n\\t   But never doubt I love.\\nO dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers. I have not\\nart to reckon my groans, but that I love thee best, O\\nmost best, believe it. Adieu.\\nThine evermore, most dear lady, whilst\\nthis machine is to him, Hamlet.\\nThis, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,\\nAnd more above, hath his solicitings,\\nAs they fell out by time, by means, and place,\\nAll given to mine ear.\\n\\nKING  But how hath she received his love?\\n\\nPOLONIUS  What do you think of me?\\n\\nKING\\nAs of a man faithful and honorable.\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nI would fain prove so. But what might you think,\\nWhen I had seen this hot love on the wing\\n(As I perceived it, I must tell you that,\\nBefore my daughter told me), what might you,\\nOr my dear Majesty your queen here, think,\\nIf I had played the desk or table-book\\nOr given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,\\nOr looked upon this love with idle sight?\\nWhat might you think? No, I went round to work,\\nAnd my young mistress thus I did bespeak:\\n\"Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.\\nThis must not be.\" And then I prescripts gave her,\\nThat she should lock herself from his resort,\\nAdmit no messengers, receive no tokens;\\nWhich done, she took the fruits of my advice,\\nAnd he, repelled (a short tale to make),\\nFell into a sadness, then into a fast,\\nThence to a watch, thence into a weakness,\\nThence to a lightness, and, by this declension,\\nInto the madness wherein now he raves\\nAnd all we mourn for.\\n\\nKING, [to Queen]  Do you think \\'tis this?\\n\\nQUEEN  It may be, very like.\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nHath there been such a time (I would fain know\\nthat)\\nThat I have positively said \"\\'Tis so,\"\\nWhen it proved otherwise?\\n\\nKING  Not that I know.\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nTake this from this, if this be otherwise.\\nIf circumstances lead me, I will find\\nWhere truth is hid, though it were hid, indeed,\\nWithin the center.\\n\\nKING  How may we try it further?\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nYou know sometimes he walks four hours together\\nHere in the lobby.\\n\\nQUEEN  So he does indeed.\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nAt such a time I\\'ll loose my daughter to him.\\n[To the King.] Be you and I behind an arras then.\\nMark the encounter. If he love her not,\\nAnd be not from his reason fall\\'n thereon,\\nLet me be no assistant for a state,\\nBut keep a farm and carters.\\n\\nKING  We will try it.\\n\\n[Enter Hamlet reading on a book.]\\n\\n\\nQUEEN\\nBut look where sadly the poor wretch comes\\nreading.\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nAway, I do beseech you both, away.\\nI\\'ll board him presently. O, give me leave.\\n[King and Queen exit with Attendants.]\\nHow does my good Lord Hamlet?\\n\\nHAMLET  Well, God-a-mercy.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  Do you know me, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  Not I, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  Then I would you were so honest a man.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  Honest, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to\\nbe one man picked out of ten thousand.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  That\\'s very true, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  For if the sun breed maggots in a dead\\ndog, being a good kissing carrion--Have you a\\ndaughter?\\n\\nPOLONIUS  I have, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  Let her not walk i\\' th\\' sun. Conception is a\\nblessing, but, as your daughter may conceive,\\nfriend, look to \\'t.\\n\\nPOLONIUS, [aside]  How say you by that? Still harping on\\nmy daughter. Yet he knew me not at first; he said I\\nwas a fishmonger. He is far gone. And truly, in my\\nyouth, I suffered much extremity for love, very near\\nthis. I\\'ll speak to him again.--What do you read, my\\nlord?\\n\\nHAMLET  Words, words, words.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  What is the matter, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  Between who?\\n\\nPOLONIUS  I mean the matter that you read, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here\\nthat old men have gray beards, that their faces are\\nwrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and\\nplum-tree gum, and that they have a plentiful lack of\\nwit, together with most weak hams; all which, sir,\\nthough I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I\\nhold it not honesty to have it thus set down; for\\nyourself, sir, shall grow old as I am, if, like a crab,\\nyou could go backward.\\n\\nPOLONIUS, [aside]  Though this be madness, yet there is\\nmethod in \\'t.--Will you walk out of the air, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  Into my grave?\\n\\nPOLONIUS  Indeed, that\\'s out of the air. [Aside.] How\\npregnant sometimes his replies are! A happiness\\nthat often madness hits on, which reason and\\nsanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I\\nwill leave him and suddenly contrive the means of\\nmeeting between him and my daughter.--My lord,\\nI will take my leave of you.\\n\\nHAMLET  You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I\\nwill more willingly part withal--except my life,\\nexcept my life, except my life.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  Fare you well, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET, [aside]  These tedious old fools.\\n\\n[Enter Guildenstern and Rosencrantz.]\\n\\n\\nPOLONIUS  You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ, [to Polonius]  God save you, sir.\\n[Polonius exits.]\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN  My honored lord.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  My most dear lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  My excellent good friends! How dost thou,\\nGuildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do\\nyou both?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nAs the indifferent children of the earth.\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN\\nHappy in that we are not overhappy.\\nOn Fortune\\'s cap, we are not the very button.\\n\\nHAMLET  Nor the soles of her shoe?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Neither, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  Then you live about her waist, or in the\\nmiddle of her favors?\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN  Faith, her privates we.\\n\\nHAMLET  In the secret parts of Fortune? O, most true!\\nShe is a strumpet. What news?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  None, my lord, but that the world\\'s\\ngrown honest.\\n\\nHAMLET  Then is doomsday near. But your news is not\\ntrue. Let me question more in particular. What\\nhave you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of\\nFortune that she sends you to prison hither?\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN  Prison, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  Denmark\\'s a prison.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Then is the world one.\\n\\nHAMLET  A goodly one, in which there are many confines,\\nwards, and dungeons, Denmark being one o\\'\\nth\\' worst.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  We think not so, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  Why, then, \\'tis none to you, for there is\\nnothing either good or bad but thinking makes it\\nso. To me, it is a prison.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Why, then, your ambition makes it one.\\n\\'Tis too narrow for your mind.\\n\\nHAMLET  O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and\\ncount myself a king of infinite space, were it not\\nthat I have bad dreams.\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN  Which dreams, indeed, are ambition,\\nfor the very substance of the ambitious is merely\\nthe shadow of a dream.\\n\\nHAMLET  A dream itself is but a shadow.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy\\nand light a quality that it is but a shadow\\'s shadow.\\n\\nHAMLET  Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs\\nand outstretched heroes the beggars\\' shadows.\\nShall we to th\\' court? For, by my fay, I cannot\\nreason.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ/GUILDENSTERN  We\\'ll wait upon you.\\n\\nHAMLET  No such matter. I will not sort you with the\\nrest of my servants, for, to speak to you like an\\nhonest man, I am most dreadfully attended. But,\\nin the beaten way of friendship, what make you at\\nElsinore?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  To visit you, my lord, no other occasion.\\n\\nHAMLET  Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks;\\nbut I thank you, and sure, dear friends, my thanks\\nare too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for?\\nIs it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation?\\nCome, come, deal justly with me. Come, come; nay,\\nspeak.\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN  What should we say, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  Anything but to th\\' purpose. You were sent\\nfor, and there is a kind of confession in your looks\\nwhich your modesties have not craft enough to\\ncolor. I know the good king and queen have sent for\\nyou.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  To what end, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  That you must teach me. But let me conjure\\nyou by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy\\nof our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved\\nlove, and by what more dear a better\\nproposer can charge you withal: be even and direct\\nwith me whether you were sent for or no.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ, [to Guildenstern]  What say you?\\n\\nHAMLET, [aside]  Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If\\nyou love me, hold not off.\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN  My lord, we were sent for.\\n\\nHAMLET  I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation\\nprevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the\\nKing and Queen molt no feather. I have of late, but\\nwherefore I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all\\ncustom of exercises, and, indeed, it goes so heavily\\nwith my disposition that this goodly frame, the\\nEarth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most\\nexcellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o\\'erhanging\\nfirmament, this majestical roof, fretted\\nwith golden fire--why, it appeareth nothing to me\\nbut a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors.\\nWhat a piece of work is a man, how noble in\\nreason, how infinite in faculties, in form and moving\\nhow express and admirable; in action how like\\nan angel, in apprehension how like a god: the\\nbeauty of the world, the paragon of animals--and\\nyet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? Man\\ndelights not me, no, nor women neither, though by\\nyour smiling you seem to say so.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  My lord, there was no such stuff in my\\nthoughts.\\n\\nHAMLET  Why did you laugh, then, when I said \"man\\ndelights not me\"?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  To think, my lord, if you delight not in\\nman, what Lenten entertainment the players shall\\nreceive from you. We coted them on the way, and\\nhither are they coming to offer you service.\\n\\nHAMLET  He that plays the king shall be welcome--his\\nMajesty shall have tribute on me. The adventurous\\nknight shall use his foil and target, the lover shall\\nnot sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his\\npart in peace, the clown shall make those laugh\\nwhose lungs are tickle o\\' th\\' sear, and the lady\\nshall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall\\nhalt for \\'t. What players are they?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Even those you were wont to take such\\ndelight in, the tragedians of the city.\\n\\nHAMLET  How chances it they travel? Their residence,\\nboth in reputation and profit, was better both ways.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  I think their inhibition comes by the\\nmeans of the late innovation.\\n\\nHAMLET  Do they hold the same estimation they did\\nwhen I was in the city? Are they so followed?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  No, indeed are they not.\\n\\nHAMLET  How comes it? Do they grow rusty?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Nay, their endeavor keeps in the wonted\\npace. But there is, sir, an aerie of children, little\\neyases, that cry out on the top of question and are\\nmost tyrannically clapped for \\'t. These are now the\\nfashion and so berattle the common stages (so\\nthey call them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid\\nof goose quills and dare scarce come thither.\\n\\nHAMLET  What, are they children? Who maintains \\'em?\\nHow are they escoted? Will they pursue the quality\\nno longer than they can sing? Will they not say\\nafterwards, if they should grow themselves to common\\nplayers (as it is most like, if their means are\\nno better), their writers do them wrong to make\\nthem exclaim against their own succession?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Faith, there has been much to-do on\\nboth sides, and the nation holds it no sin to tar\\nthem to controversy. There was for a while no\\nmoney bid for argument unless the poet and the\\nplayer went to cuffs in the question.\\n\\nHAMLET  Is \\'t possible?\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN  O, there has been much throwing\\nabout of brains.\\n\\nHAMLET  Do the boys carry it away?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Ay, that they do, my lord--Hercules\\nand his load too.\\n\\nHAMLET  It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of\\nDenmark, and those that would make mouths at\\nhim while my father lived give twenty, forty, fifty,\\na hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little.\\n\\'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural,\\nif philosophy could find it out.\\n[A flourish for the Players.]\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN  There are the players.\\n\\nHAMLET  Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore.\\nYour hands, come then. Th\\' appurtenance of welcome\\nis fashion and ceremony. Let me comply\\nwith you in this garb, lest my extent to the players,\\nwhich, I tell you, must show fairly outwards, should\\nmore appear like entertainment than yours. You are\\nwelcome. But my uncle-father and aunt-mother are\\ndeceived.\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN  In what, my dear lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  I am but mad north-north-west. When the\\nwind is southerly, I know a hawk from a handsaw.\\n\\n[Enter Polonius.]\\n\\n\\nPOLONIUS  Well be with you, gentlemen.\\n\\nHAMLET  Hark you, Guildenstern, and you too--at\\neach ear a hearer! That great baby you see there is\\nnot yet out of his swaddling clouts.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Haply he is the second time come to\\nthem, for they say an old man is twice a child.\\n\\nHAMLET  I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the\\nplayers; mark it.--You say right, sir, a Monday\\nmorning, \\'twas then indeed.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  My lord, I have news to tell you.\\n\\nHAMLET  My lord, I have news to tell you: when Roscius\\nwas an actor in Rome--\\n\\nPOLONIUS  The actors are come hither, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  Buzz, buzz.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  Upon my honor--\\n\\nHAMLET  Then came each actor on his ass.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  The best actors in the world, either for\\ntragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,\\nhistorical-pastoral, tragical-historical,\\ntragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or\\npoem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor\\nPlautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty,\\nthese are the only men.\\n\\nHAMLET  O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure\\nhadst thou!\\n\\nPOLONIUS  What a treasure had he, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  Why,\\n\\tOne fair daughter, and no more,\\n\\tThe which he loved passing well.\\n\\nPOLONIUS, [aside]  Still on my daughter.\\n\\nHAMLET  Am I not i\\' th\\' right, old Jephthah?\\n\\nPOLONIUS  If you call me \"Jephthah,\" my lord: I have a\\ndaughter that I love passing well.\\n\\nHAMLET  Nay, that follows not.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  What follows then, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  Why,\\n\\tAs by lot, God wot\\nand then, you know,\\n\\tIt came to pass, as most like it was--\\nthe first row of the pious chanson will show you\\nmore, for look where my abridgment comes.\\n\\n[Enter the Players.]\\n\\nYou are welcome, masters; welcome all.--I am glad\\nto see thee well.--Welcome, good friends.--O my\\nold friend! Why, thy face is valanced since I saw thee\\nlast. Com\\'st thou to beard me in Denmark?--What,\\nmy young lady and mistress! By \\'r Lady, your Ladyship\\nis nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by\\nthe altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a\\npiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the\\nring. Masters, you are all welcome. We\\'ll e\\'en to \\'t\\nlike French falconers, fly at anything we see. We\\'ll\\nhave a speech straight. Come, give us a taste of your\\nquality. Come, a passionate speech.\\n\\nFIRST PLAYER  What speech, my good lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it\\nwas never acted, or, if it was, not above once; for\\nthe play, I remember, pleased not the million:\\n\\'twas caviary to the general. But it was (as I\\nreceived it, and others whose judgments in such\\nmatters cried in the top of mine) an excellent play,\\nwell digested in the scenes, set down with as much\\nmodesty as cunning. I remember one said there\\nwere no sallets in the lines to make the matter\\nsavory, nor no matter in the phrase that might indict\\nthe author of affection, but called it an honest\\nmethod, as wholesome as sweet and, by very much,\\nmore handsome than fine. One speech in \\'t I\\nchiefly loved. \\'Twas Aeneas\\' tale to Dido, and\\nthereabout of it especially when he speaks of\\nPriam\\'s slaughter. If it live in your memory, begin at\\nthis line--let me see, let me see:\\nThe rugged Pyrrhus, like th\\' Hyrcanian beast--\\n\\'tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:\\nThe rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,\\nBlack as his purpose, did the night resemble\\nWhen he lay couched in th\\' ominous horse,\\nHath now this dread and black complexion smeared\\nWith heraldry more dismal. Head to foot,\\nNow is he total gules, horridly tricked\\nWith blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,\\nBaked and impasted with the parching streets,\\nThat lend a tyrannous and a damned light\\nTo their lord\\'s murder. Roasted in wrath and fire,\\nAnd thus o\\'ersized with coagulate gore,\\nWith eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus\\nOld grandsire Priam seeks.\\nSo, proceed you.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  \\'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good\\naccent and good discretion.\\n\\nFIRST PLAYER  Anon he finds him\\nStriking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,\\nRebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,\\nRepugnant to command. Unequal matched,\\nPyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;\\nBut with the whiff and wind of his fell sword\\nTh\\' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,\\nSeeming to feel this blow, with flaming top\\nStoops to his base, and with a hideous crash\\nTakes prisoner Pyrrhus\\' ear. For lo, his sword,\\nWhich was declining on the milky head\\nOf reverend Priam, seemed i\\' th\\' air to stick.\\nSo as a painted tyrant Pyrrhus stood\\nAnd, like a neutral to his will and matter,\\nDid nothing.\\nBut as we often see against some storm\\nA silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,\\nThe bold winds speechless, and the orb below\\nAs hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder\\nDoth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus\\' pause,\\nAroused vengeance sets him new a-work,\\nAnd never did the Cyclops\\' hammers fall\\nOn Mars\\'s armor, forged for proof eterne,\\nWith less remorse than Pyrrhus\\' bleeding sword\\nNow falls on Priam.\\nOut, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods\\nIn general synod take away her power,\\nBreak all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,\\nAnd bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven\\nAs low as to the fiends!\\n\\nPOLONIUS  This is too long.\\n\\nHAMLET  It shall to the barber\\'s with your beard.--\\nPrithee say on. He\\'s for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or\\nhe sleeps. Say on; come to Hecuba.\\n\\nFIRST PLAYER\\nBut who, ah woe, had seen the mobled queen--\\n\\nHAMLET  \"The mobled queen\"?\\n\\nPOLONIUS  That\\'s good. \"Mobled queen\" is good.\\n\\nFIRST PLAYER\\nRun barefoot up and down, threat\\'ning the flames\\nWith bisson rheum, a clout upon that head\\nWhere late the diadem stood, and for a robe,\\nAbout her lank and all o\\'erteemed loins\\nA blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up--\\nWho this had seen, with tongue in venom steeped,\\n\\'Gainst Fortune\\'s state would treason have\\npronounced.\\nBut if the gods themselves did see her then\\nWhen she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport\\nIn mincing with his sword her husband\\'s limbs,\\nThe instant burst of clamor that she made\\n(Unless things mortal move them not at all)\\nWould have made milch the burning eyes of heaven\\nAnd passion in the gods.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  Look whe\\'er he has not turned his color and\\nhas tears in \\'s eyes. Prithee, no more.\\n\\nHAMLET  \\'Tis well. I\\'ll have thee speak out the rest of\\nthis soon.--Good my lord, will you see the players\\nwell bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used,\\nfor they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the\\ntime. After your death you were better have a bad\\nepitaph than their ill report while you live.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  My lord, I will use them according to their\\ndesert.\\n\\nHAMLET  God\\'s bodykins, man, much better! Use every\\nman after his desert and who shall \\'scape\\nwhipping? Use them after your own honor and\\ndignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is in\\nyour bounty. Take them in.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  Come, sirs.\\n\\nHAMLET  Follow him, friends. We\\'ll hear a play\\ntomorrow. [As Polonius and Players exit, Hamlet speaks to\\nthe First Player.] Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can\\nyou play \"The Murder of Gonzago\"?\\n\\nFIRST PLAYER  Ay, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  We\\'ll ha \\'t tomorrow night. You could, for a\\nneed, study a speech of some dozen or sixteen\\nlines, which I would set down and insert in \\'t,\\ncould you not?\\n\\nFIRST PLAYER  Ay, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  Very well. Follow that lord--and look you\\nmock him not. [First Player exits.] My good friends,\\nI\\'ll leave you till night. You are welcome to Elsinore.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Good my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nAy, so, good-bye to you.\\n[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern exit.]\\nNow I am alone.\\nO, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!\\nIs it not monstrous that this player here,\\nBut in a fiction, in a dream of passion,\\nCould force his soul so to his own conceit\\nThat from her working all his visage wanned,\\nTears in his eyes, distraction in his aspect,\\nA broken voice, and his whole function suiting\\nWith forms to his conceit--and all for nothing!\\nFor Hecuba!\\nWhat\\'s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,\\nThat he should weep for her? What would he do\\nHad he the motive and the cue for passion\\nThat I have? He would drown the stage with tears\\nAnd cleave the general ear with horrid speech,\\nMake mad the guilty and appall the free,\\nConfound the ignorant and amaze indeed\\nThe very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,\\nA dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak\\nLike John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,\\nAnd can say nothing--no, not for a king\\nUpon whose property and most dear life\\nA damned defeat was made. Am I a coward?\\nWho calls me \"villain\"? breaks my pate across?\\nPlucks off my beard and blows it in my face?\\nTweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i\\' th\\' throat\\nAs deep as to the lungs? Who does me this?\\nHa! \\'Swounds, I should take it! For it cannot be\\nBut I am pigeon-livered and lack gall\\nTo make oppression bitter, or ere this\\nI should have fatted all the region kites\\nWith this slave\\'s offal. Bloody, bawdy villain!\\nRemorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless\\nvillain!\\nO vengeance!\\nWhy, what an ass am I! This is most brave,\\nThat I, the son of a dear father murdered,\\nPrompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,\\nMust, like a whore, unpack my heart with words\\nAnd fall a-cursing like a very drab,\\nA stallion! Fie upon \\'t! Foh!\\nAbout, my brains!--Hum, I have heard\\nThat guilty creatures sitting at a play\\nHave, by the very cunning of the scene,\\nBeen struck so to the soul that presently\\nThey have proclaimed their malefactions;\\nFor murder, though it have no tongue, will speak\\nWith most miraculous organ. I\\'ll have these players\\nPlay something like the murder of my father\\nBefore mine uncle. I\\'ll observe his looks;\\nI\\'ll tent him to the quick. If he do blench,\\nI know my course. The spirit that I have seen\\nMay be a devil, and the devil hath power\\nT\\' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps,\\nOut of my weakness and my melancholy,\\nAs he is very potent with such spirits,\\nAbuses me to damn me. I\\'ll have grounds\\nMore relative than this. The play\\'s the thing\\nWherein I\\'ll catch the conscience of the King.\\n[He exits.]\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Of these we told him,\\nAnd there did seem in him a kind of joy\\nTo hear of it. They are here about the court,\\nAnd, as I think, they have already order\\nThis night to play before him.\\n\\nPOLONIUS  \\'Tis most true,\\nAnd he beseeched me to entreat your Majesties\\nTo hear and see the matter.\\n\\nKING\\nWith all my heart, and it doth much content me\\nTo hear him so inclined.\\nGood gentlemen, give him a further edge\\nAnd drive his purpose into these delights.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nWe shall, my lord.\\t[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern\\nand Lords exit.]\\n\\nKING  Sweet Gertrude, leave us too,\\nFor we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,\\nThat he, as \\'twere by accident, may here\\nAffront Ophelia.\\nHer father and myself, lawful espials,\\nWill so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,\\nWe may of their encounter frankly judge\\nAnd gather by him, as he is behaved,\\nIf \\'t be th\\' affliction of his love or no\\nThat thus he suffers for.\\n\\nQUEEN  I shall obey you.\\nAnd for your part, Ophelia, I do wish\\nThat your good beauties be the happy cause\\nOf Hamlet\\'s wildness. So shall I hope your virtues\\nWill bring him to his wonted way again,\\nTo both your honors.\\n\\nOPHELIA  Madam, I wish it may.\\n[Queen exits.]\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nOphelia, walk you here.--Gracious, so please you,\\nWe will bestow ourselves. [To Ophelia.] Read on this\\nbook,\\nThat show of such an exercise may color\\nYour loneliness.--We are oft to blame in this\\n(\\'Tis too much proved), that with devotion\\'s visage\\nAnd pious action we do sugar o\\'er\\nThe devil himself.\\n\\nKING, [aside]  O, \\'tis too true!\\nHow smart a lash that speech doth give my\\nconscience.\\nThe harlot\\'s cheek beautied with plast\\'ring art\\nIs not more ugly to the thing that helps it\\nThan is my deed to my most painted word.\\nO heavy burden!\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nI hear him coming. Let\\'s withdraw, my lord.\\n[They withdraw.]\\n\\n[Enter Hamlet.]\\n\\n\\nHAMLET\\nTo be or not to be--that is the question:\\nWhether \\'tis nobler in the mind to suffer\\nThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,\\nOr to take arms against a sea of troubles\\nAnd, by opposing, end them. To die, to sleep--\\nNo more--and by a sleep to say we end\\nThe heartache and the thousand natural shocks\\nThat flesh is heir to--\\'tis a consummation\\nDevoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep--\\nTo sleep, perchance to dream. Ay, there\\'s the rub,\\nFor in that sleep of death what dreams may come,\\nWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,\\nMust give us pause. There\\'s the respect\\nThat makes calamity of so long life.\\nFor who would bear the whips and scorns of time,\\nTh\\' oppressor\\'s wrong, the proud man\\'s contumely,\\nThe pangs of despised love, the law\\'s delay,\\nThe insolence of office, and the spurns\\nThat patient merit of th\\' unworthy takes,\\nWhen he himself might his quietus make\\nWith a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,\\nTo grunt and sweat under a weary life,\\nBut that the dread of something after death,\\nThe undiscovered country from whose bourn\\nNo traveler returns, puzzles the will\\nAnd makes us rather bear those ills we have\\nThan fly to others that we know not of?\\nThus conscience does make cowards of us all,\\nAnd thus the native hue of resolution\\nIs sicklied o\\'er with the pale cast of thought,\\nAnd enterprises of great pitch and moment\\nWith this regard their currents turn awry\\nAnd lose the name of action.--Soft you now,\\nThe fair Ophelia.--Nymph, in thy orisons\\nBe all my sins remembered.\\n\\nOPHELIA  Good my lord,\\nHow does your Honor for this many a day?\\n\\nHAMLET  I humbly thank you, well.\\n\\nOPHELIA\\nMy lord, I have remembrances of yours\\nThat I have longed long to redeliver.\\nI pray you now receive them.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nNo, not I. I never gave you aught.\\n\\nOPHELIA\\nMy honored lord, you know right well you did,\\nAnd with them words of so sweet breath composed\\nAs made the things more rich. Their perfume\\nlost,\\nTake these again, for to the noble mind\\nRich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.\\nThere, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  Ha, ha, are you honest?\\n\\nOPHELIA  My lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  Are you fair?\\n\\nOPHELIA  What means your Lordship?\\n\\nHAMLET  That if you be honest and fair, your honesty\\nshould admit no discourse to your beauty.\\n\\nOPHELIA  Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce\\nthan with honesty?\\n\\nHAMLET  Ay, truly, for the power of beauty will sooner\\ntransform honesty from what it is to a bawd than\\nthe force of honesty can translate beauty into his\\nlikeness. This was sometime a paradox, but now\\nthe time gives it proof. I did love you once.\\n\\nOPHELIA  Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.\\n\\nHAMLET  You should not have believed me, for virtue\\ncannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall\\nrelish of it. I loved you not.\\n\\nOPHELIA  I was the more deceived.\\n\\nHAMLET  Get thee to a nunnery. Why wouldst thou be\\na breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest,\\nbut yet I could accuse me of such things that it\\nwere better my mother had not borne me: I am\\nvery proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offenses\\nat my beck than I have thoughts to put them\\nin, imagination to give them shape, or time to act\\nthem in. What should such fellows as I do crawling\\nbetween earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves\\nall; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.\\nWhere\\'s your father?\\n\\nOPHELIA  At home, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  Let the doors be shut upon him that he may\\nplay the fool nowhere but in \\'s own house. Farewell.\\n\\nOPHELIA  O, help him, you sweet heavens!\\n\\nHAMLET  If thou dost marry, I\\'ll give thee this plague\\nfor thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as\\nsnow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a\\nnunnery, farewell. Or if thou wilt needs marry,\\nmarry a fool, for wise men know well enough what\\nmonsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go, and\\nquickly too. Farewell.\\n\\nOPHELIA  Heavenly powers, restore him!\\n\\nHAMLET  I have heard of your paintings too, well\\nenough. God hath given you one face, and you\\nmake yourselves another. You jig and amble, and\\nyou lisp; you nickname God\\'s creatures and make\\nyour wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I\\'ll no\\nmore on \\'t. It hath made me mad. I say we will have\\nno more marriage. Those that are married already,\\nall but one, shall live. The rest shall keep as they are.\\nTo a nunnery, go.\\t[He exits.]\\n\\nOPHELIA\\nO, what a noble mind is here o\\'erthrown!\\nThe courtier\\'s, soldier\\'s, scholar\\'s, eye, tongue,\\nsword,\\nTh\\' expectancy and rose of the fair state,\\nThe glass of fashion and the mold of form,\\nTh\\' observed of all observers, quite, quite down!\\nAnd I, of ladies most deject and wretched,\\nThat sucked the honey of his musicked vows,\\nNow see that noble and most sovereign reason,\\nLike sweet bells jangled, out of time and harsh;\\nThat unmatched form and stature of blown youth\\nBlasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me\\nT\\' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!\\n\\nKING, [advancing with Polonius]\\nLove? His affections do not that way tend;\\nNor what he spake, though it lacked form a little,\\nWas not like madness. There\\'s something in his soul\\nO\\'er which his melancholy sits on brood,\\nAnd I do doubt the hatch and the disclose\\nWill be some danger; which for to prevent,\\nI have in quick determination\\nThus set it down: he shall with speed to England\\nFor the demand of our neglected tribute.\\nHaply the seas, and countries different,\\nWith variable objects, shall expel\\nThis something-settled matter in his heart,\\nWhereon his brains still beating puts him thus\\nFrom fashion of himself. What think you on \\'t?\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nIt shall do well. But yet do I believe\\nThe origin and commencement of his grief\\nSprung from neglected love.--How now, Ophelia?\\nYou need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;\\nWe heard it all.--My lord, do as you please,\\nBut, if you hold it fit, after the play\\nLet his queen-mother all alone entreat him\\nTo show his grief. Let her be round with him;\\nAnd I\\'ll be placed, so please you, in the ear\\nOf all their conference. If she find him not,\\nTo England send him, or confine him where\\nYour wisdom best shall think.\\n\\nKING  It shall be so.\\nMadness in great ones must not unwatched go.\\n[They exit.]\\n\\nScene 2\\n=======\\n[Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.]\\n\\n\\nHAMLET  Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced\\nit to you, trippingly on the tongue; but if you mouth\\nit, as many of our players do, I had as lief the\\ntown-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air\\ntoo much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;\\nfor in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,\\nwhirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and\\nbeget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O,\\nit offends me to the soul to hear a robustious,\\nperiwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very\\nrags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the\\nmost part are capable of nothing but inexplicable\\ndumb shows and noise. I would have such a fellow\\nwhipped for o\\'erdoing Termagant. It out-Herods\\nHerod. Pray you, avoid it.\\n\\nPLAYER  I warrant your Honor.\\n\\nHAMLET  Be not too tame neither, but let your own\\ndiscretion be your tutor. Suit the action to the\\nword, the word to the action, with this special\\nobservance, that you o\\'erstep not the modesty of\\nnature. For anything so o\\'erdone is from the purpose\\nof playing, whose end, both at the first and\\nnow, was and is to hold, as \\'twere, the mirror up to\\nnature, to show virtue her own feature, scorn her\\nown image, and the very age and body of the time\\nhis form and pressure. Now this overdone or come\\ntardy off, though it makes the unskillful laugh,\\ncannot but make the judicious grieve, the censure\\nof the which one must in your allowance o\\'erweigh\\na whole theater of others. O, there be players that I\\nhave seen play and heard others praise (and that\\nhighly), not to speak it profanely, that, neither\\nhaving th\\' accent of Christians nor the gait of\\nChristian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and\\nbellowed that I have thought some of nature\\'s\\njourneymen had made men, and not made them\\nwell, they imitated humanity so abominably.\\n\\nPLAYER  I hope we have reformed that indifferently\\nwith us, sir.\\n\\nHAMLET  O, reform it altogether. And let those that play\\nyour clowns speak no more than is set down for\\nthem, for there be of them that will themselves\\nlaugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators\\nto laugh too, though in the meantime some necessary\\nquestion of the play be then to be considered.\\nThat\\'s villainous and shows a most pitiful ambition\\nin the fool that uses it. Go make you ready.\\n[Players exit.]\\n\\n[Enter Polonius, Guildenstern, and Rosencrantz.]\\n\\nHow now, my lord, will the King hear this piece of\\nwork?\\n\\nPOLONIUS  And the Queen too, and that presently.\\n\\nHAMLET  Bid the players make haste.\\t[Polonius exits.]\\nWill you two help to hasten them?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Ay, my lord.\\t[They exit.]\\n\\nHAMLET  What ho, Horatio!\\n\\n[Enter Horatio.]\\n\\n\\nHORATIO  Here, sweet lord, at your service.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nHoratio, thou art e\\'en as just a man\\nAs e\\'er my conversation coped withal.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nO, my dear lord--\\n\\nHAMLET  Nay, do not think I flatter,\\nFor what advancement may I hope from thee\\nThat no revenue hast but thy good spirits\\nTo feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be\\nflattered?\\nNo, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp\\nAnd crook the pregnant hinges of the knee\\nWhere thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?\\nSince my dear soul was mistress of her choice\\nAnd could of men distinguish, her election\\nHath sealed thee for herself. For thou hast been\\nAs one in suffering all that suffers nothing,\\nA man that Fortune\\'s buffets and rewards\\nHast ta\\'en with equal thanks; and blessed are those\\nWhose blood and judgment are so well\\ncommeddled\\nThat they are not a pipe for Fortune\\'s finger\\nTo sound what stop she please. Give me that man\\nThat is not passion\\'s slave, and I will wear him\\nIn my heart\\'s core, ay, in my heart of heart,\\nAs I do thee.--Something too much of this.--\\nThere is a play tonight before the King.\\nOne scene of it comes near the circumstance\\nWhich I have told thee of my father\\'s death.\\nI prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,\\nEven with the very comment of thy soul\\nObserve my uncle. If his occulted guilt\\nDo not itself unkennel in one speech,\\nIt is a damned ghost that we have seen,\\nAnd my imaginations are as foul\\nAs Vulcan\\'s stithy. Give him heedful note,\\nFor I mine eyes will rivet to his face,\\nAnd, after, we will both our judgments join\\nIn censure of his seeming.\\n\\nHORATIO  Well, my lord.\\nIf he steal aught the whilst this play is playing\\nAnd \\'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.\\n[Sound a flourish.]\\n\\nHAMLET  They are coming to the play. I must be idle.\\nGet you a place.\\n\\n[Enter Trumpets and Kettle Drums.

I\\neat the air, promise-crammed. You cannot feed\\ncapons so.\\n\\nKING  I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These\\nwords are not mine.\\n\\nHAMLET  No, nor mine now. [To Polonius.] My lord, you\\nplayed once i\\' th\\' university, you say?\\n\\nPOLONIUS  That did I, my lord, and was accounted a\\ngood actor.\\n\\nHAMLET  What did you enact?\\n\\nPOLONIUS  I did enact Julius Caesar. I was killed i\\' th\\'\\nCapitol. Brutus killed me.\\n\\nHAMLET  It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a\\ncalf there.--Be the players ready?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Ay, my lord. They stay upon your\\npatience.\\n\\nQUEEN  Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.\\n\\nHAMLET  No, good mother.

What should a\\nman do but be merry? For look you how cheerfully\\nmy mother looks, and my father died within \\'s two\\nhours.\\n\\nOPHELIA  Nay, \\'tis twice two months, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  So long? Nay, then, let the devil wear black,\\nfor I\\'ll have a suit of sables. O heavens, die two\\nmonths ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there\\'s\\nhope a great man\\'s memory may outlive his life half\\na year. But, by \\'r Lady, he must build churches, then,\\nor else shall he suffer not thinking on, with the\\nhobby-horse, whose epitaph is \"For oh, for oh, the\\nhobby-horse is forgot.\"\\n[The trumpets sounds.

The cess of majesty\\nDies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw\\nWhat\\'s near it with it; or it is a massy wheel\\nFixed on the summit of the highest mount,\\nTo whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things\\nAre mortised and adjoined, which, when it falls,\\nEach small annexment, petty consequence,\\nAttends the boist\\'rous ruin. Never alone\\nDid the king sigh, but with a general groan.\\n\\nKING\\nArm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage,\\nFor we will fetters put about this fear,\\nWhich now goes too free-footed.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  We will haste us.\\n[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern exit.]\\n\\n[Enter Polonius.]\\n\\n\\nPOLONIUS\\nMy lord, he\\'s going to his mother\\'s closet.\\nBehind the arras I\\'ll convey myself\\nTo hear the process. I\\'ll warrant she\\'ll tax him\\nhome;\\nAnd, as you said (and wisely was it said),\\n\\'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,\\nSince nature makes them partial, should o\\'erhear\\nThe speech of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.\\nI\\'ll call upon you ere you go to bed\\nAnd tell you what I know.\\n\\nKING  Thanks, dear my lord.\\n[Polonius exits.]\\nO, my offense is rank, it smells to heaven;\\nIt hath the primal eldest curse upon \\'t,\\nA brother\\'s murder. Pray can I not,\\nThough inclination be as sharp as will.\\nMy stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,\\nAnd, like a man to double business bound,\\nI stand in pause where I shall first begin\\nAnd both neglect. What if this cursed hand\\nWere thicker than itself with brother\\'s blood?\\nIs there not rain enough in the sweet heavens\\nTo wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy\\nBut to confront the visage of offense?\\nAnd what\\'s in prayer but this twofold force,\\nTo be forestalled ere we come to fall,\\nOr pardoned being down? Then I\\'ll look up.\\nMy fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer\\nCan serve my turn? \"Forgive me my foul murder\"?\\nThat cannot be, since I am still possessed\\nOf those effects for which I did the murder:\\nMy crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.\\nMay one be pardoned and retain th\\' offense?\\nIn the corrupted currents of this world,\\nOffense\\'s gilded hand may shove by justice,\\nAnd oft \\'tis seen the wicked prize itself\\nBuys out the law. But \\'tis not so above:\\nThere is no shuffling; there the action lies\\nIn his true nature, and we ourselves compelled,\\nEven to the teeth and forehead of our faults,\\nTo give in evidence. What then? What rests?\\nTry what repentance can. What can it not?\\nYet what can it, when one cannot repent?\\nO wretched state! O bosom black as death!\\nO limed soul, that, struggling to be free,\\nArt more engaged! Help, angels!

That would be scanned:\\nA villain kills my father, and for that,\\nI, his sole son, do this same villain send\\nTo heaven.\\nWhy, this is hire and salary, not revenge.\\nHe took my father grossly, full of bread,\\nWith all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;\\nAnd how his audit stands who knows save heaven.\\nBut in our circumstance and course of thought\\n\\'Tis heavy with him. And am I then revenged\\nTo take him in the purging of his soul,\\nWhen he is fit and seasoned for his passage?\\nNo.\\nUp sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.\\n[He sheathes his sword.]\\nWhen he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,\\nOr in th\\' incestuous pleasure of his bed,\\nAt game, a-swearing, or about some act\\nThat has no relish of salvation in \\'t--\\nThen trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,\\nAnd that his soul may be as damned and black\\nAs hell, whereto it goes.

Withdraw,\\nI hear him coming.\\n[Polonius hides behind the arras.]\\n\\n[Enter Hamlet.]\\n\\n\\nHAMLET  Now, mother, what\\'s the matter?\\n\\nQUEEN\\nHamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nMother, you have my father much offended.\\n\\nQUEEN\\nCome, come, you answer with an idle tongue.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nGo, go, you question with a wicked tongue.\\n\\nQUEEN\\nWhy, how now, Hamlet?\\n\\nHAMLET  What\\'s the matter now?\\n\\nQUEEN\\nHave you forgot me?\\n\\nHAMLET  No, by the rood, not so.\\nYou are the Queen, your husband\\'s brother\\'s wife,\\nAnd (would it were not so) you are my mother.\\n\\nQUEEN\\nNay, then I\\'ll set those to you that can speak.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nCome, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge.\\nYou go not till I set you up a glass\\nWhere you may see the inmost part of you.\\n\\nQUEEN\\nWhat wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murder me?\\nHelp, ho!\\n\\nPOLONIUS, [behind the arras]  What ho! Help!\\n\\nHAMLET\\nHow now, a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead.\\n[He kills Polonius by thrusting a rapier\\nthrough the arras.]\\n\\nPOLONIUS, [behind the arras]\\nO, I am slain!\\n\\nQUEEN  O me, what hast thou done?\\n\\nHAMLET  Nay, I know not. Is it the King?\\n\\nQUEEN\\nO, what a rash and bloody deed is this!\\n\\nHAMLET\\nA bloody deed--almost as bad, good mother,\\nAs kill a king and marry with his brother.\\n\\nQUEEN\\nAs kill a king?\\n\\nHAMLET  Ay, lady, it was my word.\\n[He pulls Polonius\\' body from behind the arras.]\\nThou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell.\\nI took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.\\nThou find\\'st to be too busy is some danger.\\n[To Queen.] Leave wringing of your hands. Peace, sit\\nyou down,\\nAnd let me wring your heart; for so I shall\\nIf it be made of penetrable stuff,\\nIf damned custom have not brazed it so\\nThat it be proof and bulwark against sense.\\n\\nQUEEN\\nWhat have I done, that thou dar\\'st wag thy tongue\\nIn noise so rude against me?\\n\\nHAMLET  Such an act\\nThat blurs the grace and blush of modesty,\\nCalls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose\\nFrom the fair forehead of an innocent love\\nAnd sets a blister there, makes marriage vows\\nAs false as dicers\\' oaths--O, such a deed\\nAs from the body of contraction plucks\\nThe very soul, and sweet religion makes\\nA rhapsody of words! Heaven\\'s face does glow\\nO\\'er this solidity and compound mass\\nWith heated visage, as against the doom,\\nIs thought-sick at the act.\\n\\nQUEEN  Ay me, what act\\nThat roars so loud and thunders in the index?\\n\\nHAMLET\\nLook here upon this picture and on this,\\nThe counterfeit presentment of two brothers.\\nSee what a grace was seated on this brow,\\nHyperion\\'s curls, the front of Jove himself,\\nAn eye like Mars\\' to threaten and command,\\nA station like the herald Mercury\\nNew-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill,\\nA combination and a form indeed\\nWhere every god did seem to set his seal\\nTo give the world assurance of a man.\\nThis was your husband. Look you now what follows.\\nHere is your husband, like a mildewed ear\\nBlasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?\\nCould you on this fair mountain leave to feed\\nAnd batten on this moor? Ha! Have you eyes?\\nYou cannot call it love, for at your age\\nThe heyday in the blood is tame, it\\'s humble\\nAnd waits upon the judgment; and what judgment\\nWould step from this to this? Sense sure you have,\\nElse could you not have motion; but sure that sense\\nIs apoplexed; for madness would not err,\\nNor sense to ecstasy was ne\\'er so thralled,\\nBut it reserved some quantity of choice\\nTo serve in such a difference. What devil was \\'t\\nThat thus hath cozened you at hoodman-blind?\\nEyes without feeling, feeling without sight,\\nEars without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,\\nOr but a sickly part of one true sense\\nCould not so mope. O shame, where is thy blush?\\nRebellious hell,\\nIf thou canst mutine in a matron\\'s bones,\\nTo flaming youth let virtue be as wax\\nAnd melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame\\nWhen the compulsive ardor gives the charge,\\nSince frost itself as actively doth burn,\\nAnd reason panders will.\\n\\nQUEEN  O Hamlet, speak no more!\\nThou turn\\'st my eyes into my very soul,\\nAnd there I see such black and grained spots\\nAs will not leave their tinct.\\n\\nHAMLET  Nay, but to live\\nIn the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,\\nStewed in corruption, honeying and making love\\nOver the nasty sty!\\n\\nQUEEN  O, speak to me no more!\\nThese words like daggers enter in my ears.\\nNo more, sweet Hamlet!\\n\\nHAMLET  A murderer and a villain,\\nA slave that is not twentieth part the tithe\\nOf your precedent lord; a vice of kings,\\nA cutpurse of the empire and the rule,\\nThat from a shelf the precious diadem stole\\nAnd put it in his pocket--\\n\\nQUEEN  No more!\\n\\nHAMLET  A king of shreds and patches--\\n\\n[Enter Ghost.]\\n\\nSave me and hover o\\'er me with your wings,\\nYou heavenly guards!--What would your gracious\\nfigure?\\n\\nQUEEN  Alas, he\\'s mad.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nDo you not come your tardy son to chide,\\nThat, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by\\nTh\\' important acting of your dread command?\\nO, say!\\n\\nGHOST  Do not forget. This visitation\\nIs but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.\\nBut look, amazement on thy mother sits.\\nO, step between her and her fighting soul.\\nConceit in weakest bodies strongest works.\\nSpeak to her, Hamlet.\\n\\nHAMLET  How is it with you, lady?\\n\\nQUEEN  Alas, how is \\'t with you,\\nThat you do bend your eye on vacancy\\nAnd with th\\' incorporal air do hold discourse?\\nForth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep,\\nAnd, as the sleeping soldiers in th\\' alarm,\\nYour bedded hair, like life in excrements,\\nStart up and stand an end. O gentle son,\\nUpon the heat and flame of thy distemper\\nSprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?\\n\\nHAMLET\\nOn him, on him! Look you how pale he glares.\\nHis form and cause conjoined, preaching to stones,\\nWould make them capable. [To the Ghost.] Do not\\nlook upon me,\\nLest with this piteous action you convert\\nMy stern effects. Then what I have to do\\nWill want true color--tears perchance for blood.\\n\\nQUEEN  To whom do you speak this?\\n\\nHAMLET  Do you see nothing there?\\n\\nQUEEN\\nNothing at all; yet all that is I see.\\n\\nHAMLET  Nor did you nothing hear?\\n\\nQUEEN  No, nothing but ourselves.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nWhy, look you there, look how it steals away!\\nMy father, in his habit as he lived!\\nLook where he goes even now out at the portal!\\n[Ghost exits.]\\n\\nQUEEN\\nThis is the very coinage of your brain.\\nThis bodiless creation ecstasy\\nIs very cunning in.\\n\\nHAMLET  Ecstasy?\\nMy pulse as yours doth temperately keep time\\nAnd makes as healthful music. It is not madness\\nThat I have uttered. Bring me to the test,\\nAnd I the matter will reword, which madness\\nWould gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,\\nLay not that flattering unction to your soul\\nThat not your trespass but my madness speaks.\\nIt will but skin and film the ulcerous place,\\nWhiles rank corruption, mining all within,\\nInfects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven,\\nRepent what\\'s past, avoid what is to come,\\nAnd do not spread the compost on the weeds\\nTo make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue,\\nFor, in the fatness of these pursy times,\\nVirtue itself of vice must pardon beg,\\nYea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.\\n\\nQUEEN\\nO Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain!\\n\\nHAMLET\\nO, throw away the worser part of it,\\nAnd live the purer with the other half!\\nGood night. But go not to my uncle\\'s bed.\\nAssume a virtue if you have it not.\\nThat monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,\\nOf habits devil, is angel yet in this,\\nThat to the use of actions fair and good\\nHe likewise gives a frock or livery\\nThat aptly is put on. Refrain tonight,\\nAnd that shall lend a kind of easiness\\nTo the next abstinence, the next more easy;\\nFor use almost can change the stamp of nature\\nAnd either ... the devil or throw him out\\nWith wondrous potency. Once more, good night,\\nAnd, when you are desirous to be blest,\\nI\\'ll blessing beg of you. For this same lord\\n[Pointing to Polonius.]\\nI do repent; but heaven hath pleased it so\\nTo punish me with this and this with me,\\nThat I must be their scourge and minister.\\nI will bestow him and will answer well\\nThe death I gave him. So, again, good night.\\nI must be cruel only to be kind.\\nThis bad begins, and worse remains behind.\\nOne word more, good lady.\\n\\nQUEEN  What shall I do?\\n\\nHAMLET\\nNot this by no means that I bid you do:\\nLet the bloat king tempt you again to bed,\\nPinch wanton on your cheek, call you his mouse,\\nAnd let him, for a pair of reechy kisses\\nOr paddling in your neck with his damned fingers,\\nMake you to ravel all this matter out\\nThat I essentially am not in madness,\\nBut mad in craft. \\'Twere good you let him know,\\nFor who that\\'s but a queen, fair, sober, wise,\\nWould from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,\\nSuch dear concernings hide? Who would do so?\\nNo, in despite of sense and secrecy,\\nUnpeg the basket on the house\\'s top,\\nLet the birds fly, and like the famous ape,\\nTo try conclusions, in the basket creep\\nAnd break your own neck down.\\n\\nQUEEN\\nBe thou assured, if words be made of breath\\nAnd breath of life, I have no life to breathe\\nWhat thou hast said to me.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nI must to England, you know that.\\n\\nQUEEN  Alack,\\nI had forgot! \\'Tis so concluded on.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nThere\\'s letters sealed; and my two schoolfellows,\\nWhom I will trust as I will adders fanged,\\nThey bear the mandate; they must sweep my way\\nAnd marshal me to knavery. Let it work,\\nFor \\'tis the sport to have the enginer\\nHoist with his own petard; and \\'t shall go hard\\nBut I will delve one yard below their mines\\nAnd blow them at the moon.

How does Hamlet?\\n\\nQUEEN\\nMad as the sea and wind when both contend\\nWhich is the mightier. In his lawless fit,\\nBehind the arras hearing something stir,\\nWhips out his rapier, cries \"A rat, a rat,\"\\nAnd in this brainish apprehension kills\\nThe unseen good old man.\\n\\nKING  O heavy deed!\\nIt had been so with us, had we been there.\\nHis liberty is full of threats to all--\\nTo you yourself, to us, to everyone.\\nAlas, how shall this bloody deed be answered?\\nIt will be laid to us, whose providence\\nShould have kept short, restrained, and out of haunt\\nThis mad young man. But so much was our love,\\nWe would not understand what was most fit,\\nBut, like the owner of a foul disease,\\nTo keep it from divulging, let it feed\\nEven on the pith of life. Where is he gone?\\n\\nQUEEN\\nTo draw apart the body he hath killed,\\nO\\'er whom his very madness, like some ore\\nAmong a mineral of metals base,\\nShows itself pure: he weeps for what is done.\\n\\nKING  O Gertrude, come away!\\nThe sun no sooner shall the mountains touch\\nBut we will ship him hence; and this vile deed\\nWe must with all our majesty and skill\\nBoth countenance and excuse.--Ho, Guildenstern!\\n\\n[Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]\\n\\nFriends both, go join you with some further aid.\\nHamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,\\nAnd from his mother\\'s closet hath he dragged him.\\nGo seek him out, speak fair, and bring the body\\nInto the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.\\n[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern exit.]\\nCome, Gertrude, we\\'ll call up our wisest friends\\nAnd let them know both what we mean to do\\nAnd what\\'s untimely done. ...\\nWhose whisper o\\'er the world\\'s diameter,\\nAs level as the cannon to his blank\\nTransports his poisoned shot, may miss our name\\nAnd hit the woundless air. O, come away!\\nMy soul is full of discord and dismay.\\n[They exit.]\\n\\nScene 2\\n=======\\n[Enter Hamlet.]\\n\\n\\nHAMLET  Safely stowed.\\n\\nGENTLEMEN, [within]  Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!\\n\\nHAMLET  But soft, what noise? Who calls on Hamlet?\\nO, here they come.\\n\\n[Enter Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and others.]\\n\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nWhat have you done, my lord, with the dead body?\\n\\nHAMLET\\nCompounded it with dust, whereto \\'tis kin.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nTell us where \\'tis, that we may take it thence\\nAnd bear it to the chapel.\\n\\nHAMLET  Do not believe it.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Believe what?\\n\\nHAMLET  That I can keep your counsel and not mine\\nown. Besides, to be demanded of a sponge, what\\nreplication should be made by the son of a king?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Take you me for a sponge, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  Ay, sir, that soaks up the King\\'s countenance,\\nhis rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the\\nKing best service in the end. He keeps them like an\\nape an apple in the corner of his jaw, first mouthed,\\nto be last swallowed. When he needs what you have\\ngleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you\\nshall be dry again.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  I understand you not, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a\\nfoolish ear.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  My lord, you must tell us where the\\nbody is and go with us to the King.\\n\\nHAMLET  The body is with the King, but the King is not\\nwith the body. The King is a thing--\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN  A \"thing,\" my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and\\nall after!\\n[They exit.]\\n\\nScene 3\\n=======\\n[Enter King and two or three.]\\n\\n\\nKING\\nI have sent to seek him and to find the body.\\nHow dangerous is it that this man goes loose!\\nYet must not we put the strong law on him.\\nHe\\'s loved of the distracted multitude,\\nWho like not in their judgment, but their eyes;\\nAnd, where \\'tis so, th\\' offender\\'s scourge is weighed,\\nBut never the offense. To bear all smooth and even,\\nThis sudden sending him away must seem\\nDeliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown\\nBy desperate appliance are relieved\\nOr not at all.\\n\\n[Enter Rosencrantz.]\\n\\nHow now, what hath befallen?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nWhere the dead body is bestowed, my lord,\\nWe cannot get from him.\\n\\nKING  But where is he?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nWithout, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.\\n\\nKING\\nBring him before us.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Ho! Bring in the lord.\\n\\n[They enter with Hamlet.]\\n\\n\\nKING  Now, Hamlet, where\\'s Polonius?\\n\\nHAMLET  At supper.\\n\\nKING  At supper where?\\n\\nHAMLET  Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A\\ncertain convocation of politic worms are e\\'en at\\nhim. Your worm is your only emperor for diet. We\\nfat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves\\nfor maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar is\\nbut variable service--two dishes but to one table.\\nThat\\'s the end.\\n\\nKING  Alas, alas!\\n\\nHAMLET  A man may fish with the worm that hath eat\\nof a king and eat of the fish that hath fed of that\\nworm.\\n\\nKING  What dost thou mean by this?\\n\\nHAMLET  Nothing but to show you how a king may go a\\nprogress through the guts of a beggar.\\n\\nKING  Where is Polonius?\\n\\nHAMLET  In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger\\nfind him not there, seek him i\\' th\\' other\\nplace yourself. But if, indeed, you find him not\\nwithin this month, you shall nose him as you go up\\nthe stairs into the lobby.\\n\\nKING, [to Attendants.]  Go, seek him there.\\n\\nHAMLET  He will stay till you come.\\t[Attendants exit.]\\n\\nKING\\nHamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety\\n(Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve\\nFor that which thou hast done) must send thee\\nhence\\nWith fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.\\nThe bark is ready, and the wind at help,\\nTh\\' associates tend, and everything is bent\\nFor England.\\n\\nHAMLET  For England?\\n\\nKING  Ay, Hamlet.\\n\\nHAMLET  Good.\\n\\nKING\\nSo is it, if thou knew\\'st our purposes.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nI see a cherub that sees them. But come, for\\nEngland.\\nFarewell, dear mother.\\n\\nKING  Thy loving father, Hamlet.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nMy mother. Father and mother is man and wife,\\nMan and wife is one flesh, and so, my mother.--\\nCome, for England.\\t[He exits.]\\n\\nKING\\nFollow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.\\nDelay it not. I\\'ll have him hence tonight.\\nAway, for everything is sealed and done\\nThat else leans on th\\' affair. Pray you, make haste.\\n[All but the King exit.]\\nAnd England, if my love thou hold\\'st at aught\\n(As my great power thereof may give thee sense,\\nSince yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red\\nAfter the Danish sword, and thy free awe\\nPays homage to us), thou mayst not coldly set\\nOur sovereign process, which imports at full,\\nBy letters congruing to that effect,\\nThe present death of Hamlet. Do it, England,\\nFor like the hectic in my blood he rages,\\nAnd thou must cure me. Till I know \\'tis done,\\nHowe\\'er my haps, my joys will ne\\'er begin.\\n[He exits.]\\n\\nScene 4\\n=======\\n[Enter Fortinbras with his army over the stage.]\\n\\n\\nFORTINBRAS\\nGo, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.\\nTell him that by his license Fortinbras\\nCraves the conveyance of a promised march\\nOver his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.\\nIf that his Majesty would aught with us,\\nWe shall express our duty in his eye;\\nAnd let him know so.\\n\\nCAPTAIN  I will do \\'t, my lord.\\n\\nFORTINBRAS  Go softly on.\\t[All but the Captain exit.]\\n\\n[Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and others.]\\n\\n\\nHAMLET  Good sir, whose powers are these?\\n\\nCAPTAIN  They are of Norway, sir.\\n\\nHAMLET  How purposed, sir, I pray you?\\n\\nCAPTAIN  Against some part of Poland.\\n\\nHAMLET  Who commands them, sir?\\n\\nCAPTAIN\\nThe nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nGoes it against the main of Poland, sir,\\nOr for some frontier?\\n\\nCAPTAIN\\nTruly to speak, and with no addition,\\nWe go to gain a little patch of ground\\nThat hath in it no profit but the name.\\nTo pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;\\nNor will it yield to Norway or the Pole\\nA ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nWhy, then, the Polack never will defend it.\\n\\nCAPTAIN\\nYes, it is already garrisoned.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nTwo thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats\\nWill not debate the question of this straw.\\nThis is th\\' impostume of much wealth and peace,\\nThat inward breaks and shows no cause without\\nWhy the man dies.--I humbly thank you, sir.\\n\\nCAPTAIN  God be wi\\' you, sir.\\t[He exits.]\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ  Will \\'t please you go, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET\\nI\\'ll be with you straight. Go a little before.\\n[All but Hamlet exit.]\\nHow all occasions do inform against me\\nAnd spur my dull revenge. What is a man\\nIf his chief good and market of his time\\nBe but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.\\nSure He that made us with such large discourse,\\nLooking before and after, gave us not\\nThat capability and godlike reason\\nTo fust in us unused. Now whether it be\\nBestial oblivion or some craven scruple\\nOf thinking too precisely on th\\' event\\n(A thought which, quartered, hath but one part\\nwisdom\\nAnd ever three parts coward), I do not know\\nWhy yet I live to say \"This thing\\'s to do,\"\\nSith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means\\nTo do \\'t. Examples gross as Earth exhort me:\\nWitness this army of such mass and charge,\\nLed by a delicate and tender prince,\\nWhose spirit with divine ambition puffed\\nMakes mouths at the invisible event,\\nExposing what is mortal and unsure\\nTo all that fortune, death, and danger dare,\\nEven for an eggshell. Rightly to be great\\nIs not to stir without great argument,\\nBut greatly to find quarrel in a straw\\nWhen honor\\'s at the stake. How stand I, then,\\nThat have a father killed, a mother stained,\\nExcitements of my reason and my blood,\\nAnd let all sleep, while to my shame I see\\nThe imminent death of twenty thousand men\\nThat for a fantasy and trick of fame\\nGo to their graves like beds, fight for a plot\\nWhereon the numbers cannot try the cause,\\nWhich is not tomb enough and continent\\nTo hide the slain? O, from this time forth\\nMy thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth!\\n[He exits.]\\n\\nScene 5\\n=======\\n[Enter Horatio, Queen, and a Gentleman.]\\n\\n\\nQUEEN  I will not speak with her.\\n\\nGENTLEMAN  She is importunate,\\nIndeed distract; her mood will needs be pitied.\\n\\nQUEEN  What would she have?\\n\\nGENTLEMAN\\nShe speaks much of her father, says she hears\\nThere\\'s tricks i\\' th\\' world, and hems, and beats her\\nheart,\\nSpurns enviously at straws, speaks things in doubt\\nThat carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,\\nYet the unshaped use of it doth move\\nThe hearers to collection. They aim at it\\nAnd botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;\\nWhich, as her winks and nods and gestures yield\\nthem,\\nIndeed would make one think there might be\\nthought,\\nThough nothing sure, yet much unhappily.\\n\\nHORATIO\\n\\'Twere good she were spoken with, for she may\\nstrew\\nDangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.\\n\\nQUEEN  Let her come in.\\t[Gentleman exits.]\\n[Aside.] To my sick soul (as sin\\'s true nature is),\\nEach toy seems prologue to some great amiss.\\nSo full of artless jealousy is guilt,\\nIt spills itself in fearing to be spilt.\\n\\n[Enter Ophelia distracted.]\\n\\n\\nOPHELIA\\nWhere is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?\\n\\nQUEEN  How now, Ophelia?\\n\\nOPHELIA [sings]\\n\\tHow should I your true love know\\n\\t   From another one?\\n\\tBy his cockle hat and staff\\n\\t   And his sandal shoon.\\n\\nQUEEN\\nAlas, sweet lady, what imports this song?\\n\\nOPHELIA  Say you?

Good night, ladies, good night, sweet\\nladies, good night, good night.\\t[She exits.]\\n\\nKING\\nFollow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.\\n[Horatio exits.]\\nO, this is the poison of deep grief.

They have dealt with me like\\nthieves of mercy, but they knew what they did: I am to\\ndo a good turn for them. Let the King have the letters\\nI have sent, and repair thou to me with as much speed\\nas thou wouldst fly death.

But tell me\\nWhy you proceeded not against these feats,\\nSo criminal and so capital in nature,\\nAs by your safety, greatness, wisdom, all things else,\\nYou mainly were stirred up.\\n\\nKING  O, for two special reasons,\\nWhich may to you perhaps seem much unsinewed,\\nBut yet to me they\\'re strong. The Queen his mother\\nLives almost by his looks, and for myself\\n(My virtue or my plague, be it either which),\\nShe is so conjunctive to my life and soul\\nThat, as the star moves not but in his sphere,\\nI could not but by her. The other motive\\nWhy to a public count I might not go\\nIs the great love the general gender bear him,\\nWho, dipping all his faults in their affection,\\nWork like the spring that turneth wood to stone,\\nConvert his gyves to graces, so that my arrows,\\nToo slightly timbered for so loud a wind,\\nWould have reverted to my bow again,\\nBut not where I have aimed them.\\n\\nLAERTES\\nAnd so have I a noble father lost,\\nA sister driven into desp\\'rate terms,\\nWhose worth, if praises may go back again,\\nStood challenger on mount of all the age\\nFor her perfections. But my revenge will come.\\n\\nKING\\nBreak not your sleeps for that. You must not think\\nThat we are made of stuff so flat and dull\\nThat we can let our beard be shook with danger\\nAnd think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.\\nI loved your father, and we love ourself,\\nAnd that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--\\n\\n[Enter a Messenger with letters.]\\n\\nHow now? What news?\\n\\nMESSENGER  Letters, my lord, from\\nHamlet.\\nThese to your Majesty, this to the Queen.\\n\\nKING  From Hamlet? Who brought them?\\n\\nMESSENGER\\nSailors, my lord, they say. I saw them not.\\nThey were given me by Claudio.

If he be now returned,\\nAs checking at his voyage, and that he means\\nNo more to undertake it, I will work him\\nTo an exploit, now ripe in my device,\\nUnder the which he shall not choose but fall;\\nAnd for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,\\nBut even his mother shall uncharge the practice\\nAnd call it accident.\\n\\nLAERTES  My lord, I will be ruled,\\nThe rather if you could devise it so\\nThat I might be the organ.\\n\\nKING  It falls right.\\nYou have been talked of since your travel much,\\nAnd that in Hamlet\\'s hearing, for a quality\\nWherein they say you shine. Your sum of parts\\nDid not together pluck such envy from him\\nAs did that one, and that, in my regard,\\nOf the unworthiest siege.\\n\\nLAERTES  What part is that, my lord?\\n\\nKING\\nA very ribbon in the cap of youth--\\nYet needful too, for youth no less becomes\\nThe light and careless livery that it wears\\nThan settled age his sables and his weeds,\\nImporting health and graveness. Two months since\\nHere was a gentleman of Normandy.\\nI have seen myself, and served against, the French,\\nAnd they can well on horseback, but this gallant\\nHad witchcraft in \\'t. He grew unto his seat,\\nAnd to such wondrous doing brought his horse\\nAs had he been encorpsed and demi-natured\\nWith the brave beast. So far he topped my thought\\nThat I in forgery of shapes and tricks\\nCome short of what he did.\\n\\nLAERTES  A Norman was \\'t?\\n\\nKING  A Norman.\\n\\nLAERTES\\nUpon my life, Lamord.\\n\\nKING  The very same.\\n\\nLAERTES\\nI know him well. He is the brooch indeed\\nAnd gem of all the nation.\\n\\nKING  He made confession of you\\nAnd gave you such a masterly report\\nFor art and exercise in your defense,\\nAnd for your rapier most especial,\\nThat he cried out \\'twould be a sight indeed\\nIf one could match you. The \\'scrimers of their\\nnation\\nHe swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,\\nIf you opposed them. Sir, this report of his\\nDid Hamlet so envenom with his envy\\nThat he could nothing do but wish and beg\\nYour sudden coming-o\\'er, to play with you.\\nNow out of this--\\n\\nLAERTES  What out of this, my lord?\\n\\nKING\\nLaertes, was your father dear to you?\\nOr are you like the painting of a sorrow,\\nA face without a heart?\\n\\nLAERTES  Why ask you this?\\n\\nKING\\nNot that I think you did not love your father,\\nBut that I know love is begun by time\\nAnd that I see, in passages of proof,\\nTime qualifies the spark and fire of it.\\nThere lives within the very flame of love\\nA kind of wick or snuff that will abate it,\\nAnd nothing is at a like goodness still;\\nFor goodness, growing to a pleurisy,\\nDies in his own too-much. That we would do\\nWe should do when we would; for this \"would\"\\nchanges\\nAnd hath abatements and delays as many\\nAs there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;\\nAnd then this \"should\" is like a spendthrift sigh,\\nThat hurts by easing. But to the quick of th\\' ulcer:\\nHamlet comes back; what would you undertake\\nTo show yourself indeed your father\\'s son\\nMore than in words?\\n\\nLAERTES  To cut his throat i\\' th\\' church.\\n\\nKING\\nNo place indeed should murder sanctuarize;\\nRevenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,\\nWill you do this? Keep close within your chamber.\\nHamlet, returned, shall know you are come home.\\nWe\\'ll put on those shall praise your excellence\\nAnd set a double varnish on the fame\\nThe Frenchman gave you; bring you, in fine,\\ntogether\\nAnd wager on your heads. He, being remiss,\\nMost generous, and free from all contriving,\\nWill not peruse the foils, so that with ease,\\nOr with a little shuffling, you may choose\\nA sword unbated, and in a pass of practice\\nRequite him for your father.\\n\\nLAERTES  I will do \\'t,\\nAnd for that purpose I\\'ll anoint my sword.\\nI bought an unction of a mountebank\\nSo mortal that, but dip a knife in it,\\nWhere it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,\\nCollected from all simples that have virtue\\nUnder the moon, can save the thing from death\\nThat is but scratched withal. I\\'ll touch my point\\nWith this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,\\nIt may be death.\\n\\nKING  Let\\'s further think of this,\\nWeigh what convenience both of time and means\\nMay fit us to our shape. If this should fail,\\nAnd that our drift look through our bad\\nperformance,\\n\\'Twere better not assayed. Therefore this project\\nShould have a back or second that might hold\\nIf this did blast in proof. Soft, let me see.\\nWe\\'ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings--\\nI ha \\'t!\\nWhen in your motion you are hot and dry\\n(As make your bouts more violent to that end)\\nAnd that he calls for drink, I\\'ll have prepared\\nhim\\nA chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,\\nIf he by chance escape your venomed stuck,\\nOur purpose may hold there.--But stay, what\\nnoise?\\n\\n[Enter Queen.]\\n\\n\\nQUEEN\\nOne woe doth tread upon another\\'s heel,\\nSo fast they follow.

Therefore make her grave\\nstraight. The crowner hath sat on her and finds it\\nChristian burial.\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  How can that be, unless she drowned\\nherself in her own defense?\\n\\nOTHER  Why, \\'tis found so.\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  It must be se offendendo; it cannot be\\nelse. For here lies the point: if I drown myself\\nwittingly, it argues an act, and an act hath three\\nbranches--it is to act, to do, to perform. Argal, she\\ndrowned herself wittingly.\\n\\nOTHER  Nay, but hear you, goodman delver--\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  Give me leave. Here lies the water;\\ngood. Here stands the man; good. If the man go to\\nthis water and drown himself, it is (will he, nill he)\\nhe goes; mark you that. But if the water come to him\\nand drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he\\nthat is not guilty of his own death shortens not his\\nown life.\\n\\nOTHER  But is this law?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  Ay, marry, is \\'t--crowner\\'s \\'quest law.\\n\\nOTHER  Will you ha\\' the truth on \\'t? If this had not been\\na gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o\\'\\nChristian burial.\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  Why, there thou sayst. And the more\\npity that great folk should have count\\'nance in this\\nworld to drown or hang themselves more than\\ntheir even-Christian. Come, my spade. There is no\\nancient gentlemen but gard\\'ners, ditchers, and\\ngrave-makers. They hold up Adam\\'s profession.\\n\\nOTHER  Was he a gentleman?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  He was the first that ever bore arms.\\n\\nOTHER  Why, he had none.\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  What, art a heathen? How dost thou\\nunderstand the scripture? The scripture says Adam\\ndigged. Could he dig without arms? I\\'ll put another\\nquestion to thee. If thou answerest me not to the\\npurpose, confess thyself--\\n\\nOTHER  Go to!\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  What is he that builds stronger than\\neither the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?\\n\\nOTHER  The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a\\nthousand tenants.\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  I like thy wit well, in good faith. The\\ngallows does well. But how does it well? It does\\nwell to those that do ill. Now, thou dost ill to say the\\ngallows is built stronger than the church. Argal, the\\ngallows may do well to thee. To \\'t again, come.\\n\\nOTHER  \"Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright,\\nor a carpenter?\"\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.\\n\\nOTHER  Marry, now I can tell.\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  To \\'t.\\n\\nOTHER  Mass, I cannot tell.\\n\\n[Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.]\\n\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  Cudgel thy brains no more about it,\\nfor your dull ass will not mend his pace with\\nbeating. And, when you are asked this question\\nnext, say \"a grave-maker.\" The houses he makes\\nlasts till doomsday. Go, get thee in, and fetch me a\\nstoup of liquor.\\n[The Other Man exits\\nand the Gravedigger digs and sings.]\\n\\tIn youth when I did love, did love,\\n\\t   Methought it was very sweet\\n\\tTo contract--O--the time for--a--my behove,\\n\\t   O, methought there--a--was nothing--a--meet.\\n\\nHAMLET  Has this fellow no feeling of his business? He\\nsings in grave-making.\\n\\nHORATIO  Custom hath made it in him a property of\\neasiness.\\n\\nHAMLET  \\'Tis e\\'en so. The hand of little employment\\nhath the daintier sense.\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER [sings]\\n\\tBut age with his stealing steps\\n\\tHath clawed me in his clutch,\\n\\tAnd hath shipped me into the land,\\n\\tAs if I had never been such.\\n[He digs up a skull.]\\n\\nHAMLET  That skull had a tongue in it and could sing\\nonce. How the knave jowls it to the ground as if\\n\\'twere Cain\\'s jawbone, that did the first murder!\\nThis might be the pate of a politician which this ass\\nnow o\\'erreaches, one that would circumvent God,\\nmight it not?\\n\\nHORATIO  It might, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  Or of a courtier, which could say \"Good\\nmorrow, sweet lord! How dost thou, sweet lord?\"\\nThis might be my Lord Such-a-one that praised my\\nLord Such-a-one\\'s horse when he went to beg it,\\nmight it not?\\n\\nHORATIO  Ay, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  Why, e\\'en so. And now my Lady Worm\\'s,\\nchapless and knocked about the mazard with a\\nsexton\\'s spade. Here\\'s fine revolution, an we had\\nthe trick to see \\'t.

Why may not that be the\\nskull of a lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his\\nquillities, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? Why\\ndoes he suffer this mad knave now to knock him\\nabout the sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell\\nhim of his action of battery? Hum, this fellow might\\nbe in \\'s time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,\\nhis recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,\\nhis recoveries. Is this the fine of his fines and the\\nrecovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full\\nof fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more\\nof his purchases, and double ones too, than the\\nlength and breadth of a pair of indentures? The very\\nconveyances of his lands will scarcely lie in this box,\\nand must th\\' inheritor himself have no more, ha?\\n\\nHORATIO  Not a jot more, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  Is not parchment made of sheepskins?\\n\\nHORATIO  Ay, my lord, and of calves\\' skins too.\\n\\nHAMLET  They are sheep and calves which seek out\\nassurance in that. I will speak to this fellow.--\\nWhose grave\\'s this, sirrah?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  Mine, sir.\\n[Sings.]\\tO, a pit of clay for to be made\\n\\tFor such a guest is meet.\\n\\nHAMLET  I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in \\'t.\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  You lie out on \\'t, sir, and therefore \\'tis\\nnot yours. For my part, I do not lie in \\'t, yet it is\\nmine.\\n\\nHAMLET  Thou dost lie in \\'t, to be in \\'t and say it is thine.\\n\\'Tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou\\nliest.\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  \\'Tis a quick lie, sir; \\'twill away again\\nfrom me to you.\\n\\nHAMLET  What man dost thou dig it for?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  For no man, sir.\\n\\nHAMLET  What woman then?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  For none, neither.\\n\\nHAMLET  Who is to be buried in \\'t?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  One that was a woman, sir, but, rest\\nher soul, she\\'s dead.\\n\\nHAMLET  How absolute the knave is! We must speak by\\nthe card, or equivocation will undo us. By the\\nLord, Horatio, this three years I have took note of\\nit: the age is grown so picked that the toe of the\\npeasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he\\ngalls his kibe.--How long hast thou been\\ngrave-maker?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  Of all the days i\\' th\\' year, I came to \\'t\\nthat day that our last King Hamlet overcame\\nFortinbras.\\n\\nHAMLET  How long is that since?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  Cannot you tell that? Every fool can\\ntell that. It was that very day that young Hamlet\\nwas born--he that is mad, and sent into England.\\n\\nHAMLET  Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  Why, because he was mad. He shall\\nrecover his wits there. Or if he do not, \\'tis no great\\nmatter there.\\n\\nHAMLET  Why?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  \\'Twill not be seen in him there. There\\nthe men are as mad as he.\\n\\nHAMLET  How came he mad?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  Very strangely, they say.\\n\\nHAMLET  How \"strangely\"?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  Faith, e\\'en with losing his wits.\\n\\nHAMLET  Upon what ground?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  Why, here in Denmark. I have been\\nsexton here, man and boy, thirty years.\\n\\nHAMLET  How long will a man lie i\\' th\\' earth ere he rot?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  Faith, if he be not rotten before he die\\n(as we have many pocky corses nowadays that will\\nscarce hold the laying in), he will last you some\\neight year or nine year. A tanner will last you nine\\nyear.\\n\\nHAMLET  Why he more than another?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his\\ntrade that he will keep out water a great while; and\\nyour water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead\\nbody. Here\\'s a skull now hath lien you i\\' th\\' earth\\nthree-and-twenty years.\\n\\nHAMLET  Whose was it?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  A whoreson mad fellow\\'s it was.\\nWhose do you think it was?\\n\\nHAMLET  Nay, I know not.\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  A pestilence on him for a mad rogue!\\nHe poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once.\\nThis same skull, sir, was, sir, Yorick\\'s skull, the\\nKing\\'s jester.\\n\\nHAMLET  This?\\n\\nGRAVEDIGGER  E\\'en that.\\n\\nHAMLET, [taking the skull]  Let me see. Alas, poor\\nYorick! I knew him, Horatio--a fellow of infinite\\njest, of most excellent fancy. He hath bore me on his\\nback a thousand times, and now how abhorred in\\nmy imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung\\nthose lips that I have kissed I know not how oft.\\nWhere be your gibes now? your gambols? your\\nsongs? your flashes of merriment that were wont to\\nset the table on a roar? Not one now to mock your\\nown grinning? Quite chapfallen? Now get you to my\\nlady\\'s chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch\\nthick, to this favor she must come. Make her laugh\\nat that.--Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing.\\n\\nHORATIO  What\\'s that, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET  Dost thou think Alexander looked o\\' this\\nfashion i\\' th\\' earth?\\n\\nHORATIO  E\\'en so.\\n\\nHAMLET  And smelt so? Pah!\\t[He puts the skull down.]\\n\\nHORATIO  E\\'en so, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  To what base uses we may return, Horatio!\\nWhy may not imagination trace the noble dust of\\nAlexander till he find it stopping a bunghole?\\n\\nHORATIO  \\'Twere to consider too curiously to consider\\nso.\\n\\nHAMLET  No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither,\\nwith modesty enough and likelihood to lead it, as\\nthus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander\\nreturneth to dust; the dust is earth; of earth\\nwe make loam; and why of that loam whereto he\\nwas converted might they not stop a beer barrel?\\nImperious Caesar, dead and turned to clay,\\nMight stop a hole to keep the wind away.\\nO, that that earth which kept the world in awe\\nShould patch a wall t\\' expel the winter\\'s flaw!\\n\\n[Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Lords attendant, and the\\ncorpse of Ophelia, with a Doctor of Divinity.]\\n\\nBut soft, but soft awhile! Here comes the King,\\nThe Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?\\nAnd with such maimed rites? This doth betoken\\nThe corse they follow did with desp\\'rate hand\\nFordo its own life. \\'Twas of some estate.\\nCouch we awhile and mark.\\t[They step aside.]\\n\\nLAERTES  What ceremony else?\\n\\nHAMLET  That is Laertes, a very noble youth. Mark.\\n\\nLAERTES  What ceremony else?\\n\\nDOCTOR\\nHer obsequies have been as far enlarged\\nAs we have warranty. Her death was doubtful,\\nAnd, but that great command o\\'ersways the order,\\nShe should in ground unsanctified been lodged\\nTill the last trumpet. For charitable prayers\\nShards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on\\nher.\\nYet here she is allowed her virgin crants,\\nHer maiden strewments, and the bringing home\\nOf bell and burial.\\n\\nLAERTES\\nMust there no more be done?\\n\\nDOCTOR  No more be done.\\nWe should profane the service of the dead\\nTo sing a requiem and such rest to her\\nAs to peace-parted souls.\\n\\nLAERTES  Lay her i\\' th\\' earth,\\nAnd from her fair and unpolluted flesh\\nMay violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,\\nA minist\\'ring angel shall my sister be\\nWhen thou liest howling.\\n\\nHAMLET, [to Horatio]  What, the fair Ophelia?\\n\\nQUEEN  Sweets to the sweet, farewell!\\n[She scatters flowers.]\\nI hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet\\'s wife;\\nI thought thy bride-bed to have decked, sweet maid,\\nAnd not have strewed thy grave.\\n\\nLAERTES  O, treble woe\\nFall ten times treble on that cursed head\\nWhose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense\\nDeprived thee of!--Hold off the earth awhile,\\nTill I have caught her once more in mine arms.\\n[Leaps in the grave.]\\nNow pile your dust upon the quick and dead,\\nTill of this flat a mountain you have made\\nT\\' o\\'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head\\nOf blue Olympus.\\n\\nHAMLET, [advancing]\\nWhat is he whose grief\\nBears such an emphasis, whose phrase of sorrow\\nConjures the wand\\'ring stars and makes them stand\\nLike wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,\\nHamlet the Dane.\\n\\nLAERTES, [coming out of the grave]\\nThe devil take thy soul!\\n\\nHAMLET  Thou pray\\'st not well.\\t[They grapple.]\\nI prithee take thy fingers from my throat,\\nFor though I am not splenitive and rash,\\nYet have I in me something dangerous,\\nWhich let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand.\\n\\nKING  Pluck them asunder.\\n\\nQUEEN  Hamlet! Hamlet!\\n\\nALL  Gentlemen!\\n\\nHORATIO  Good my lord, be quiet.\\n[Hamlet and Laertes are separated.]\\n\\nHAMLET\\nWhy, I will fight with him upon this theme\\nUntil my eyelids will no longer wag!\\n\\nQUEEN  O my son, what theme?\\n\\nHAMLET\\nI loved Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers\\nCould not with all their quantity of love\\nMake up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?\\n\\nKING  O, he is mad, Laertes!\\n\\nQUEEN  For love of God, forbear him.\\n\\nHAMLET  \\'Swounds, show me what thou \\'t do.\\nWoo\\'t weep, woo\\'t fight, woo\\'t fast, woo\\'t tear\\nthyself,\\nWoo\\'t drink up eisel, eat a crocodile?\\nI\\'ll do \\'t. Dost thou come here to whine?\\nTo outface me with leaping in her grave?\\nBe buried quick with her, and so will I.\\nAnd if thou prate of mountains, let them throw\\nMillions of acres on us, till our ground,\\nSingeing his pate against the burning zone,\\nMake Ossa like a wart. Nay, an thou \\'lt mouth,\\nI\\'ll rant as well as thou.\\n\\nQUEEN  This is mere madness;\\nAnd thus awhile the fit will work on him.\\nAnon, as patient as the female dove\\nWhen that her golden couplets are disclosed,\\nHis silence will sit drooping.\\n\\nHAMLET  Hear you, sir,\\nWhat is the reason that you use me thus?\\nI loved you ever. But it is no matter.\\nLet Hercules himself do what he may,\\nThe cat will mew, and dog will have his day.\\n[Hamlet exits.]\\n\\nKING\\nI pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.\\n[Horatio exits.]\\n[To Laertes.] Strengthen your patience in our last\\nnight\\'s speech.\\nWe\\'ll put the matter to the present push.--\\nGood Gertrude, set some watch over your son.--\\nThis grave shall have a living monument.\\nAn hour of quiet thereby shall we see.\\nTill then in patience our proceeding be.\\n[They exit.]\\n\\nScene 2\\n=======\\n[Enter Hamlet and Horatio.]\\n\\n\\nHAMLET\\nSo much for this, sir. Now shall you see the other.\\nYou do remember all the circumstance?\\n\\nHORATIO  Remember it, my lord!\\n\\nHAMLET\\nSir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting\\nThat would not let me sleep. Methought I lay\\nWorse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly--\\nAnd praised be rashness for it; let us know,\\nOur indiscretion sometime serves us well\\nWhen our deep plots do pall; and that should learn\\nus\\nThere\\'s a divinity that shapes our ends,\\nRough-hew them how we will--\\n\\nHORATIO  That is most\\ncertain.\\n\\nHAMLET  Up from my cabin,\\nMy sea-gown scarfed about me, in the dark\\nGroped I to find out them; had my desire,\\nFingered their packet, and in fine withdrew\\nTo mine own room again, making so bold\\n(My fears forgetting manners) to unfold\\nTheir grand commission; where I found, Horatio,\\nA royal knavery--an exact command,\\nLarded with many several sorts of reasons\\nImporting Denmark\\'s health and England\\'s too,\\nWith--ho!--such bugs and goblins in my life,\\nThat on the supervise, no leisure bated,\\nNo, not to stay the grinding of the ax,\\nMy head should be struck off.\\n\\nHORATIO  Is \\'t possible?\\n\\nHAMLET\\nHere\\'s the commission. Read it at more leisure.\\n[Handing him a paper.]\\nBut wilt thou hear now how I did proceed?\\n\\nHORATIO  I beseech you.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nBeing thus benetted round with villainies,\\nOr I could make a prologue to my brains,\\nThey had begun the play. I sat me down,\\nDevised a new commission, wrote it fair--\\nI once did hold it, as our statists do,\\nA baseness to write fair, and labored much\\nHow to forget that learning; but, sir, now\\nIt did me yeoman\\'s service. Wilt thou know\\nTh\\' effect of what I wrote?\\n\\nHORATIO  Ay, good my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nAn earnest conjuration from the King,\\nAs England was his faithful tributary,\\nAs love between them like the palm might flourish,\\nAs peace should still her wheaten garland wear\\nAnd stand a comma \\'tween their amities,\\nAnd many suchlike ases of great charge,\\nThat, on the view and knowing of these contents,\\nWithout debatement further, more or less,\\nHe should those bearers put to sudden death,\\nNot shriving time allowed.\\n\\nHORATIO  How was this sealed?\\n\\nHAMLET\\nWhy, even in that was heaven ordinant.\\nI had my father\\'s signet in my purse,\\nWhich was the model of that Danish seal;\\nFolded the writ up in the form of th\\' other,\\nSubscribed it, gave \\'t th\\' impression, placed it\\nsafely,\\nThe changeling never known. Now, the next day\\nWas our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent\\nThou knowest already.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nSo Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to \\'t.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nWhy, man, they did make love to this employment.\\nThey are not near my conscience. Their defeat\\nDoes by their own insinuation grow.\\n\\'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes\\nBetween the pass and fell incensed points\\nOf mighty opposites.\\n\\nHORATIO  Why, what a king is this!\\n\\nHAMLET\\nDoes it not, think thee, stand me now upon--\\nHe that hath killed my king and whored my mother,\\nPopped in between th\\' election and my hopes,\\nThrown out his angle for my proper life,\\nAnd with such cozenage--is \\'t not perfect\\nconscience\\nTo quit him with this arm? And is \\'t not to be\\ndamned\\nTo let this canker of our nature come\\nIn further evil?\\n\\nHORATIO\\nIt must be shortly known to him from England\\nWhat is the issue of the business there.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nIt will be short. The interim\\'s mine,\\nAnd a man\\'s life\\'s no more than to say \"one.\"\\nBut I am very sorry, good Horatio,\\nThat to Laertes I forgot myself,\\nFor by the image of my cause I see\\nThe portraiture of his. I\\'ll court his favors.\\nBut, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me\\nInto a tow\\'ring passion.\\n\\nHORATIO  Peace, who comes here?\\n\\n[Enter Osric, a courtier.]\\n\\n\\nOSRIC  Your Lordship is right welcome back to\\nDenmark.\\n\\nHAMLET  I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio.]\\nDost know this waterfly?\\n\\nHORATIO, [aside to Hamlet]  No, my good lord.\\n\\nHAMLET, [aside to Horatio]  Thy state is the more gracious,\\nfor \\'tis a vice to know him. He hath much\\nland, and fertile. Let a beast be lord of beasts and his\\ncrib shall stand at the king\\'s mess. \\'Tis a chough,\\nbut, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.\\n\\nOSRIC  Sweet lord, if your Lordship were at leisure, I\\nshould impart a thing to you from his Majesty.\\n\\nHAMLET  I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of\\nspirit. Put your bonnet to his right use: \\'tis for the\\nhead.\\n\\nOSRIC  I thank your Lordship; it is very hot.\\n\\nHAMLET  No, believe me, \\'tis very cold; the wind is\\nnortherly.\\n\\nOSRIC  It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.\\n\\nHAMLET  But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for\\nmy complexion.\\n\\nOSRIC  Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as\\n\\'twere--I cannot tell how. My lord, his Majesty\\nbade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager\\non your head. Sir, this is the matter--\\n\\nHAMLET  I beseech you, remember. [He motions to\\nOsric to put on his hat.]\\n\\nOSRIC  Nay, good my lord, for my ease, in good faith.\\nSir, here is newly come to court Laertes--believe\\nme, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent\\ndifferences, of very soft society and great showing.\\nIndeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or\\ncalendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the\\ncontinent of what part a gentleman would see.\\n\\nHAMLET  Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in\\nyou, though I know to divide him inventorially\\nwould dozy th\\' arithmetic of memory, and yet but\\nyaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the\\nverity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great\\narticle, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness\\nas, to make true diction of him, his semblable is his\\nmirror, and who else would trace him, his umbrage,\\nnothing more.\\n\\nOSRIC  Your Lordship speaks most infallibly of him.\\n\\nHAMLET  The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the\\ngentleman in our more rawer breath?\\n\\nOSRIC  Sir?\\n\\nHORATIO  Is \\'t not possible to understand in another\\ntongue? You will to \\'t, sir, really.\\n\\nHAMLET, [to Osric]  What imports the nomination of\\nthis gentleman?\\n\\nOSRIC  Of Laertes?\\n\\nHORATIO  His purse is empty already; all \\'s golden words\\nare spent.\\n\\nHAMLET  Of him, sir.\\n\\nOSRIC  I know you are not ignorant--\\n\\nHAMLET  I would you did, sir. Yet, in faith, if you did, it\\nwould not much approve me. Well, sir?\\n\\nOSRIC  You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes\\nis--\\n\\nHAMLET  I dare not confess that, lest I should compare\\nwith him in excellence. But to know a man well\\nwere to know himself.\\n\\nOSRIC  I mean, sir, for his weapon. But in the imputation\\nlaid on him by them, in his meed he\\'s\\nunfellowed.\\n\\nHAMLET  What\\'s his weapon?\\n\\nOSRIC  Rapier and dagger.\\n\\nHAMLET  That\\'s two of his weapons. But, well--\\n\\nOSRIC  The King, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary\\nhorses, against the which he has impawned, as I\\ntake it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their\\nassigns, as girdle, hangers, and so. Three of the\\ncarriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very\\nresponsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and\\nof very liberal conceit.\\n\\nHAMLET  What call you the \"carriages\"?\\n\\nHORATIO  I knew you must be edified by the margent\\nere you had done.\\n\\nOSRIC  The carriages, sir, are the hangers.\\n\\nHAMLET  The phrase would be more germane to the\\nmatter if we could carry a cannon by our sides. I\\nwould it might be \"hangers\" till then. But on. Six\\nBarbary horses against six French swords, their\\nassigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages--\\nthat\\'s the French bet against the Danish. Why is this\\nall \"impawned,\" as you call it?\\n\\nOSRIC  The King, sir, hath laid, sir, that in a dozen\\npasses between yourself and him, he shall not\\nexceed you three hits. He hath laid on twelve for\\nnine, and it would come to immediate trial if your\\nLordship would vouchsafe the answer.\\n\\nHAMLET  How if I answer no?\\n\\nOSRIC  I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person\\nin trial.\\n\\nHAMLET  Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his\\nMajesty, it is the breathing time of day with me. Let\\nthe foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the\\nKing hold his purpose, I will win for him, an I can.\\nIf not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd\\nhits.\\n\\nOSRIC  Shall I deliver you e\\'en so?\\n\\nHAMLET  To this effect, sir, after what flourish your\\nnature will.\\n\\nOSRIC  I commend my duty to your Lordship.\\n\\nHAMLET  Yours. [Osric exits.] He does well to commend\\nit himself. There are no tongues else for \\'s\\nturn.\\n\\nHORATIO  This lapwing runs away with the shell on his\\nhead.\\n\\nHAMLET  He did comply, sir, with his dug before he\\nsucked it. Thus has he (and many more of the same\\nbreed that I know the drossy age dotes on) only got\\nthe tune of the time, and, out of an habit of\\nencounter, a kind of yeasty collection, which carries\\nthem through and through the most fanned\\nand winnowed opinions; and do but blow them to\\ntheir trial, the bubbles are out.\\n\\n[Enter a Lord.]\\n\\n\\nLORD  My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by\\nyoung Osric, who brings back to him that you\\nattend him in the hall. He sends to know if your\\npleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will\\ntake longer time.\\n\\nHAMLET  I am constant to my purposes. They follow\\nthe King\\'s pleasure. If his fitness speaks, mine is\\nready now or whensoever, provided I be so able as\\nnow.\\n\\nLORD  The King and Queen and all are coming down.\\n\\nHAMLET  In happy time.\\n\\nLORD  The Queen desires you to use some gentle\\nentertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.\\n\\nHAMLET  She well instructs me.\\t[Lord exits.]\\n\\nHORATIO  You will lose, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET  I do not think so. Since he went into France, I\\nhave been in continual practice. I shall win at the\\nodds; but thou wouldst not think how ill all\\'s here\\nabout my heart. But it is no matter.\\n\\nHORATIO  Nay, good my lord--\\n\\nHAMLET  It is but foolery, but it is such a kind of\\ngaingiving as would perhaps trouble a woman.\\n\\nHORATIO  If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will\\nforestall their repair hither and say you are not fit.\\n\\nHAMLET  Not a whit. We defy augury. There is a\\nspecial providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be\\nnow, \\'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be\\nnow; if it be not now, yet it will come. The\\nreadiness is all. Since no man of aught he leaves\\nknows, what is \\'t to leave betimes? Let be.\\n\\n[A table prepared. Enter Trumpets, Drums, and Officers\\nwith cushions, King, Queen, Osric, and all the state,\\nfoils, daggers, flagons of wine, and Laertes.]\\n\\n\\nKING\\nCome, Hamlet, come and take this hand from me.\\n[He puts Laertes\\' hand into Hamlet\\'s.]\\n\\nHAMLET, [to Laertes]\\nGive me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;\\nBut pardon \\'t as you are a gentleman. This presence\\nknows,\\nAnd you must needs have heard, how I am punished\\nWith a sore distraction. What I have done\\nThat might your nature, honor, and exception\\nRoughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.\\nWas \\'t Hamlet wronged Laertes? Never Hamlet.\\nIf Hamlet from himself be ta\\'en away,\\nAnd when he\\'s not himself does wrong Laertes,\\nThen Hamlet does it not; Hamlet denies it.\\nWho does it, then? His madness. If \\'t be so,\\nHamlet is of the faction that is wronged;\\nHis madness is poor Hamlet\\'s enemy.\\nSir, in this audience\\nLet my disclaiming from a purposed evil\\nFree me so far in your most generous thoughts\\nThat I have shot my arrow o\\'er the house\\nAnd hurt my brother.\\n\\nLAERTES  I am satisfied in nature,\\nWhose motive in this case should stir me most\\nTo my revenge; but in my terms of honor\\nI stand aloof and will no reconcilement\\nTill by some elder masters of known honor\\nI have a voice and precedent of peace\\nTo keep my name ungored. But till that time\\nI do receive your offered love like love\\nAnd will not wrong it.\\n\\nHAMLET  I embrace it freely\\nAnd will this brothers\\' wager frankly play.--\\nGive us the foils. Come on.\\n\\nLAERTES  Come, one for me.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nI\\'ll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance\\nYour skill shall, like a star i\\' th\\' darkest night,\\nStick fiery off indeed.\\n\\nLAERTES  You mock me, sir.\\n\\nHAMLET  No, by this hand.\\n\\nKING\\nGive them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,\\nYou know the wager?\\n\\nHAMLET  Very well, my lord.\\nYour Grace has laid the odds o\\' th\\' weaker side.\\n\\nKING\\nI do not fear it; I have seen you both.\\nBut, since he is better, we have therefore odds.\\n\\nLAERTES\\nThis is too heavy. Let me see another.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nThis likes me well. These foils have all a length?\\n\\nOSRIC  Ay, my good lord.\\n[Prepare to play.]\\n\\nKING\\nSet me the stoups of wine upon that table.--\\nIf Hamlet give the first or second hit\\nOr quit in answer of the third exchange,\\nLet all the battlements their ordnance fire.\\nThe King shall drink to Hamlet\\'s better breath,\\nAnd in the cup an union shall he throw,\\nRicher than that which four successive kings\\nIn Denmark\\'s crown have worn. Give me the cups,\\nAnd let the kettle to the trumpet speak,\\nThe trumpet to the cannoneer without,\\nThe cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,\\n\"Now the King drinks to Hamlet.\" Come, begin.\\nAnd you, the judges, bear a wary eye.\\n[Trumpets the while.]\\n\\nHAMLET  Come on, sir.\\n\\nLAERTES  Come, my lord.\\t[They play.]\\n\\nHAMLET  One.\\n\\nLAERTES  No.\\n\\nHAMLET  Judgment!\\n\\nOSRIC  A hit, a very palpable hit.\\n\\nLAERTES  Well, again.\\n\\nKING\\nStay, give me drink.--Hamlet, this pearl is thine.\\nHere\\'s to thy health.\\n[He drinks and then drops the pearl in the cup.]\\n[Drum, trumpets, and shot.]\\nGive him the cup.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nI\\'ll play this bout first. Set it by awhile.\\nCome. [They play.] Another hit. What say you?\\n\\nLAERTES\\nA touch, a touch. I do confess \\'t.\\n\\nKING\\nOur son shall win.\\n\\nQUEEN  He\\'s fat and scant of breath.--\\nHere, Hamlet, take my napkin; rub thy brows.\\nThe Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.\\n[She lifts the cup.]\\n\\nHAMLET  Good madam.\\n\\nKING  Gertrude, do not drink.\\n\\nQUEEN\\nI will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.\\t[She drinks.]\\n\\nKING, [aside]\\nIt is the poisoned cup. It is too late.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nI dare not drink yet, madam--by and by.\\n\\nQUEEN  Come, let me wipe thy face.\\n\\nLAERTES, [to Claudius]\\nMy lord, I\\'ll hit him now.\\n\\nKING  I do not think \\'t.\\n\\nLAERTES, [aside]\\nAnd yet it is almost against my conscience.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nCome, for the third, Laertes. You do but dally.\\nI pray you pass with your best violence.\\nI am afeard you make a wanton of me.\\n\\nLAERTES  Say you so? Come on.\\t[Play.]\\n\\nOSRIC  Nothing neither way.\\n\\nLAERTES  Have at you now!\\n[Laertes wounds Hamlet. Then in scuffling they change\\nrapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes.]\\n\\nKING  Part them. They are incensed.\\n\\nHAMLET  Nay, come again.\\n[The Queen falls.]\\n\\nOSRIC  Look to the Queen there, ho!\\n\\nHORATIO\\nThey bleed on both sides.--How is it, my lord?\\n\\nOSRIC  How is \\'t, Laertes?\\n\\nLAERTES\\nWhy as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.\\n[He falls.]\\nI am justly killed with mine own treachery.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nHow does the Queen?\\n\\nKING  She swoons to see them bleed.\\n\\nQUEEN\\nNo, no, the drink, the drink! O, my dear Hamlet!\\nThe drink, the drink! I am poisoned.\\t[She dies.]\\n\\nHAMLET\\nO villainy! Ho! Let the door be locked.\\t[Osric exits.]\\nTreachery! Seek it out.\\n\\nLAERTES\\nIt is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain.\\nNo med\\'cine in the world can do thee good.\\nIn thee there is not half an hour\\'s life.\\nThe treacherous instrument is in thy hand,\\nUnbated and envenomed. The foul practice\\nHath turned itself on me. Lo, here I lie,\\nNever to rise again. Thy mother\\'s poisoned.\\nI can no more. The King, the King\\'s to blame.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nThe point envenomed too! Then, venom, to thy\\nwork.\\t[Hurts the King.]\\n\\nALL  Treason, treason!\\n\\nKING\\nO, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nHere, thou incestuous, murd\\'rous, damned Dane,\\nDrink off this potion. Is thy union here?\\n[Forcing him to drink the poison.]\\nFollow my mother.\\t[King dies.]\\n\\nLAERTES  He is justly served.\\nIt is a poison tempered by himself.\\nExchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.\\nMine and my father\\'s death come not upon thee,\\nNor thine on me.\\t[Dies.]\\n\\nHAMLET\\nHeaven make thee free of it. I follow thee.--\\nI am dead, Horatio.--Wretched queen, adieu.--\\nYou that look pale and tremble at this chance,\\nThat are but mutes or audience to this act,\\nHad I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,\\nIs strict in his arrest), O, I could tell you--\\nBut let it be.--Horatio, I am dead.\\nThou livest; report me and my cause aright\\nTo the unsatisfied.\\n\\nHORATIO  Never believe it.\\nI am more an antique Roman than a Dane.\\nHere\\'s yet some liquor left.\\t[He picks up the cup.]\\n\\nHAMLET  As thou \\'rt a man,\\nGive me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I\\'ll ha \\'t.\\nO God, Horatio, what a wounded name,\\nThings standing thus unknown, shall I leave behind\\nme!\\nIf thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,\\nAbsent thee from felicity awhile\\nAnd in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain\\nTo tell my story.\\n[A march afar off and shot within.]\\nWhat warlike noise is this?\\n\\n[Enter Osric.]\\n\\n\\nOSRIC\\nYoung Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,\\nTo th\\' ambassadors of England gives\\nThis warlike volley.\\n\\nHAMLET  O, I die, Horatio!\\nThe potent poison quite o\\'ercrows my spirit.\\nI cannot live to hear the news from England.\\nBut I do prophesy th\\' election lights\\nOn Fortinbras; he has my dying voice.\\nSo tell him, with th\\' occurrents, more and less,\\nWhich have solicited--the rest is silence.\\nO, O, O, O!\\t[Dies.]\\n\\nHORATIO\\nNow cracks a noble heart.

O proud Death,\\nWhat feast is toward in thine eternal cell\\nThat thou so many princes at a shot\\nSo bloodily hast struck?\\n\\nAMBASSADOR  The sight is dismal,\\nAnd our affairs from England come too late.\\nThe ears are senseless that should give us hearing\\nTo tell him his commandment is fulfilled,\\nThat Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.\\nWhere should we have our thanks?\\n\\nHORATIO  Not from his\\nmouth,\\nHad it th\\' ability of life to thank you.\\nHe never gave commandment for their death.\\nBut since, so jump upon this bloody question,\\nYou from the Polack wars, and you from England,\\nAre here arrived, give order that these bodies\\nHigh on a stage be placed to the view,\\nAnd let me speak to th\\' yet unknowing world\\nHow these things came about. So shall you hear\\nOf carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,\\nOf accidental judgments, casual slaughters,\\nOf deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,\\nAnd, in this upshot, purposes mistook\\nFall\\'n on th\\' inventors\\' heads.

I\\'ll go no\\nfurther.\\n\\nGHOST\\nMark me.\\n\\nHAMLET  I will.\\n\\nGHOST  My hour is almost come\\nWhen I to sulf\\'rous and tormenting flames\\nMust render up myself.\\n\\nHAMLET  Alas, poor ghost!\\n\\nGHOST\\nPity me not, but lend thy serious hearing\\nTo what I shall unfold.\\n\\nHAMLET  Speak. I am bound to hear.\\n\\nGHOST\\nSo art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.\\n\\nHAMLET  What?\\n\\nGHOST  I am thy father\\'s spirit,\\nDoomed for a certain term to walk the night\\nAnd for the day confined to fast in fires\\nTill the foul crimes done in my days of nature\\nAre burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid\\nTo tell the secrets of my prison house,\\nI could a tale unfold whose lightest word\\nWould harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,\\nMake thy two eyes, like stars, start from their\\nspheres,\\nThy knotted and combined locks to part,\\nAnd each particular hair to stand an end,\\nLike quills upon the fearful porpentine.\\nBut this eternal blazon must not be\\nTo ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O list!\\nIf thou didst ever thy dear father love--\\n\\nHAMLET  O God!\\n\\nGHOST\\nRevenge his foul and most unnatural murder.\\n\\nHAMLET  Murder?\\n\\nGHOST\\nMurder most foul, as in the best it is,\\nBut this most foul, strange, and unnatural.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nHaste me to know \\'t, that I, with wings as swift\\nAs meditation or the thoughts of love,\\nMay sweep to my revenge.\\n\\nGHOST  I find thee apt;\\nAnd duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed\\nThat roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,\\nWouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.\\n\\'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,\\nA serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark\\nIs by a forged process of my death\\nRankly abused. But know, thou noble youth,\\nThe serpent that did sting thy father\\'s life\\nNow wears his crown.\\n\\nHAMLET  O, my prophetic soul! My uncle!\\n\\nGHOST\\nAy, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,\\nWith witchcraft of his wits, with traitorous gifts--\\nO wicked wit and gifts, that have the power\\nSo to seduce!--won to his shameful lust\\nThe will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.\\nO Hamlet, what a falling off was there!\\nFrom me, whose love was of that dignity\\nThat it went hand in hand even with the vow\\nI made to her in marriage, and to decline\\nUpon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor\\nTo those of mine.\\nBut virtue, as it never will be moved,\\nThough lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,\\nSo, lust, though to a radiant angel linked,\\nWill sate itself in a celestial bed\\nAnd prey on garbage.\\nBut soft, methinks I scent the morning air.\\nBrief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,\\nMy custom always of the afternoon,\\nUpon my secure hour thy uncle stole\\nWith juice of cursed hebona in a vial\\nAnd in the porches of my ears did pour\\nThe leprous distilment, whose effect\\nHolds such an enmity with blood of man\\nThat swift as quicksilver it courses through\\nThe natural gates and alleys of the body,\\nAnd with a sudden vigor it doth posset\\nAnd curd, like eager droppings into milk,\\nThe thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine,\\nAnd a most instant tetter barked about,\\nMost lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust\\nAll my smooth body.\\nThus was I, sleeping, by a brother\\'s hand\\nOf life, of crown, of queen at once dispatched,\\nCut off, even in the blossoms of my sin,\\nUnhouseled, disappointed, unaneled,\\nNo reck\\'ning made, but sent to my account\\nWith all my imperfections on my head.\\nO horrible, O horrible, most horrible!\\nIf thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.\\nLet not the royal bed of Denmark be\\nA couch for luxury and damned incest.\\nBut, howsomever thou pursues this act,\\nTaint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive\\nAgainst thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven\\nAnd to those thorns that in her bosom lodge\\nTo prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.\\nThe glowworm shows the matin to be near\\nAnd \\'gins to pale his uneffectual fire.\\nAdieu, adieu, adieu. Remember me.\\t[He exits.]\\n\\nHAMLET\\nO all you host of heaven! O Earth! What else?\\nAnd shall I couple hell? O fie! Hold, hold, my heart,\\nAnd you, my sinews, grow not instant old,\\nBut bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?\\nAy, thou poor ghost, whiles memory holds a seat\\nIn this distracted globe. Remember thee?\\nYea, from the table of my memory\\nI\\'ll wipe away all trivial, fond records,\\nAll saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,\\nThat youth and observation copied there,\\nAnd thy commandment all alone shall live\\nWithin the book and volume of my brain,\\nUnmixed with baser matter.

Touching this vision here,\\nIt is an honest ghost--that let me tell you.\\nFor your desire to know what is between us,\\nO\\'ermaster \\'t as you may. And now, good friends,\\nAs you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,\\nGive me one poor request.\\n\\nHORATIO  What is \\'t, my lord? We will.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nNever make known what you have seen tonight.\\n\\nHORATIO/MARCELLUS   My lord, we will not.\\n\\nHAMLET  Nay, but swear \\'t.\\n\\nHORATIO  In faith, my lord, not I.\\n\\nMARCELLUS  Nor I, my lord, in faith.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nUpon my sword.\\n\\nMARCELLUS  We have sworn, my lord, already.\\n\\nHAMLET  Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.\\n\\nGHOST [cries under the stage]  Swear.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nHa, ha, boy, sayst thou so? Art thou there,\\ntruepenny?\\nCome on, you hear this fellow in the cellarage.\\nConsent to swear.\\n\\nHORATIO  Propose the oath, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nNever to speak of this that you have seen,\\nSwear by my sword.\\n\\nGHOST, [beneath]  Swear.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nHic et ubique? Then we\\'ll shift our ground.\\nCome hither, gentlemen,\\nAnd lay your hands again upon my sword.\\nSwear by my sword\\nNever to speak of this that you have heard.\\n\\nGHOST, [beneath]  Swear by his sword.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nWell said, old mole. Canst work i\\' th\\' earth so fast?--\\nA worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.\\n\\nHORATIO\\nO day and night, but this is wondrous strange.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nAnd therefore as a stranger give it welcome.\\nThere are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,\\nThan are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come.\\nHere, as before, never, so help you mercy,\\nHow strange or odd some\\'er I bear myself\\n(As I perchance hereafter shall think meet\\nTo put an antic disposition on)\\nThat you, at such times seeing me, never shall,\\nWith arms encumbered thus, or this headshake,\\nOr by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,\\nAs \"Well, well, we know,\" or \"We could an if we\\nwould,\"\\nOr \"If we list to speak,\" or \"There be an if they\\nmight,\"\\nOr such ambiguous giving-out, to note\\nThat you know aught of me--this do swear,\\nSo grace and mercy at your most need help you.\\n\\nGHOST, [beneath]  Swear.\\n\\nHAMLET\\nRest, rest, perturbed spirit.--So, gentlemen,\\nWith all my love I do commend me to you,\\nAnd what so poor a man as Hamlet is\\nMay do t\\' express his love and friending to you,\\nGod willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together,\\nAnd still your fingers on your lips, I pray.\\nThe time is out of joint.
