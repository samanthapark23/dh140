# Profile
My name is Samantha Park. I'm a fourth year Psychology major and Digital Humanities Minor at UCLA. I'm from Cary, North Carolina but I was born and raised in South Korea. I took PIC 10A during my second year, but I don't remember a lot since I haven't coded ever since that class. 

# Description of the Course
DH 140 is an introductory course for the language of Python and general coding skills. The course also interacts with the field of humanities as it explores how Python can be used in the field.

# Project Ideas
I would be interested in analyzing 
⋅⋅* social networks
⋅⋅* data regarding COVID
⋅⋅* cross-cultural differences 

# My Objectives for DH 140
I aim to learn how to code in Python. I hope to learn the basics of coding in general as well so that learning other coding languages become more approchable after this course. In the process of learning Python, I'm also excited to be able to apply this skill to examine real-life phenomenon.
